A selector for choosing glycan residues based on their layer - as measured by the residue distance to the start of the glycan tree.If no layer is set, will select all glycan residues.

```xml
<GlycanLayerSelector name="(&string;)" start="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        end="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        layer_as_greater_than_or_equal_to="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        layer_as_less_than_or_equal_to="(&non_negative_integer;)" />
```

-   **start**: Start of the glycan layer we are selecting from.0-N
-   **end**: End of the glycan layer we are selecting from.1-N
-   **layer_as_greater_than_or_equal_to**: Set the layer as all residues greater than or equal to this number (such as the end of the tree)
-   **layer_as_less_than_or_equal_to**: Set the layer as all residue less or equal to this number (the beginning of the tree)
