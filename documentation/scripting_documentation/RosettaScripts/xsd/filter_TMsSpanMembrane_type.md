Computes the overall sasa of the pose.

```xml
<TMsSpanMembrane name="(&string;)" threshold="(0.5 &real;)"
        output_file="(&string;)" min_distance="(20 &real;)"
        flank="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        required_distance="(10 &non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: leave 0.5 for boolean behaviour
-   **output_file**: file to which print output
-   **min_distance**: minimal distance between TMH edges over the Z axis (membrane depth)
-   **flank**: by how many residues 'enlarge' the TMH to allow a more fuzzy test
-   **required_distance**: the distance the edges should be from the membrane edge
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
