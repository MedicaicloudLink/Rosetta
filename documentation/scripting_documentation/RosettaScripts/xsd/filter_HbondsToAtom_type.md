This filter counts the number of residues that form sufficiently energetically favorable H-bonds to a selected atom

```xml
<HbondsToAtom name="(&string;)" partners="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        energy_cutoff="(-0.5 &real;)" bb_bb="(0 &bool;)" backbone="(0 &bool;)"
        sidechain="(1 &bool;)" pdb_num="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        atomname="(&string;)" res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **partners**: H-bonding partner expectation, below which counts as failure
-   **energy_cutoff**: Energy below which a H-bond counts
-   **bb_bb**: Count backbone-backbone H-bonds
-   **backbone**: Count backbone H-bonds
-   **sidechain**: Count sidechain H-bonds
-   **pdb_num**: Particular residue of interest
-   **atomname**: (REQUIRED) Atom name to which to examine H-bonds
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
