@brief Simple mover to Create a sequence motif in a region of protein using the
SequenceMotifTaskOperation.  Uses psueo-regular expressions to define the motif.

@details Simply calls the packer using the operation, optionally packing neighbor residues as it does so.
 If you need something more complex, use the SequenceMotifTaskOperation directly.

```xml
<CreateSequenceMotifMover name="(&string;)" motif="(&string;)"
        pack_neighbors="(true &bool;)" design_neighbors="(false &bool;)"
        neighbor_distance="(6.0 &real;)"
        pack_rounds="(5 &non_negative_integer;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **motif**: This is slightly similar to a regex, but not quite. We are not matching a sequence,
   we are designing in a motif regardless of the current sequence, anywhere in a protein.

   - Each letter corresponds to a position. Using [ ] indicates a more complicated expression for that position.
   - An X indicates it can be anything, and that we are designing here.
   - An AA Letter, like V, indicates that that position will be designed to a V.
   - A - charactor indicates that that position stays with whatever it is currently.  We essentially skip this position.
   - An expression like: [^PAV] indicates that we will design anything except Proline, Alanine, and Valine 
   - An expression like: [NTS] indicates that that position can be Asparigine, Threonine, or Serine and 
      only of these will be enabled during the design.
   - RESFILE commands are accepted as well. These require a % charactor in from of the whole expression.
     For example [%POLAR] would set that position to only polar design.

 EXAMPLE:
  Glycosylation N-Linked motif design: N[^P][ST]
-   **pack_neighbors**: Should we pack the neighboring residues to the motif during design?
-   **design_neighbors**: Should we design the neighboring residues to the motif during design?
-   **neighbor_distance**: Packing distance to neighbors?
-   **pack_rounds**: Number of rounds to run packing/design.
-   **residue_selector**: The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
