this filter basically works exactly as ResidueBurialFilter, but with the advantage that it has the capability to figure out resid of the ligand

```xml
<LigBurial name="(&string;)" lig_id="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        distance="(8.0 &real;)" neighbors="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **lig_id**: an input other than 0 (or no input at all) indicates no ligand present
-   **distance**: distance around which the ligand to count neighboring atoms
-   **neighbors**: integer representing the number of neighbors count
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
