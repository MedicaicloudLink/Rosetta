Client mover that perturbs torsion angles in the pose with a gaussian distribution of the provided magnitude

```xml
<StructPerturberCM name="(&string;)" magnitude="(2.0 &real;)"
        label="(BASE &string;)" />
```

-   **magnitude**: Maximum magnitude of torsion angle change to make to in each step
-   **label**: Defaults to BASE
