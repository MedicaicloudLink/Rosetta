Print the Pose's labels

```xml
<DisplayPoseLabelsMover name="(&string;)" title_width="(15 &string;)"
        use_dssp="(1 &bool;)" write="(0 &bool;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        task_factory="(&string;)" packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)"
        movemap_factory="(&string;)" />
```

-   **title_width**: Width assigned to print the label names to garantee alignment of the representation.
-   **use_dssp**: Use DSSP if the Pose has no Secondary Structure Assigned (is all loop).
-   **write**: Write the LABELS as a REMARK in the output structure or silent file (overwrites previous REMARKS with the title LABELS).
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **task_factory**: A TaskFactory specification to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **movemap_factory**: MoveMapFactory to print aligned to the residues
