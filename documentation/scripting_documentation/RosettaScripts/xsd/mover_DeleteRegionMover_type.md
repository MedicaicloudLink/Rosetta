Deletes a region from a pose

```xml
<DeleteRegionMover name="(&string;)" rechain="(&bool;)" start="(&string;)"
        end="(&string;)" nter_overhang="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        cter_overhang="(&non_negative_integer;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **rechain**: Add terminus variants and recompute chains after deleting
-   **start**: First residue in region to delete (PDBNum (24A) or RosettaNum
-   **end**: Last residue in region to delete
-   **nter_overhang**: Number of additional residues to delete on the N terminal side
-   **cter_overhang**: Number of additional residues to delete on the C terminal side
-   **residue_selector**: ResidueSelector with region(s) to delete
