Evaluate to a value contingent on the true/false value of other filters. Each of the IF clauses are evaluated in order. If the testfilter evaluates to true, the real-valued result of the IfThenFilter is the real-valued return value of the valuefilter, multiplied by the corresponding weight. (If inverttest is true, a false testfilter will cause valuefilter evaluation.) Alternatively, you can omit the valuefilter, and give a literal value with the value parameter (which will also be multiplied by the given weight). If none of the IF clauses return true for their testfilters, then the real-valued result of the ELSE clause valuefilter (or the corresponding literal value) multiplied by the weight is used as the value instead. For truth value testing, the default is to return true if the value is less than or equal to the given threshold. If lower_threshold is true, then IfThenFilter returns true if the value is greater than or equal to the threshold.

```xml
<IfThenFilter name="(&string;)" threshold="(0.0 &real;)"
        lower_threshold="(false &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" >
    <IF valuefilter="(&string;)" value="(0.0 &real;)" weight="(1.0 &real;)"
            testfilter="(&string;)" inverttest="(false &bool;)" />
    <ELIF valuefilter="(&string;)" value="(0.0 &real;)" weight="(1.0 &real;)"
            testfilter="(&string;)" inverttest="(false &bool;)" />
    <ELSE valuefilter="(&string;)" value="(0.0 &real;)" weight="(1.0 &real;)" />
</IfThenFilter>
```

-   **threshold**: XRW TO DO
-   **lower_threshold**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter


Subtag **IF**:   

-   **valuefilter**: XRW TODO
-   **value**: Value of the filter used when returned true
-   **weight**: The value will be multiplied with weight in case of true
-   **testfilter**: (REQUIRED) If testfilter returns true its value will be multiplied by the weight as final result
-   **inverttest**: Inverses the filter result

Subtag **ELIF**:   

-   **valuefilter**: XRW TODO
-   **value**: Value of the filter used when returned true
-   **weight**: The value will be multiplied with weight in case of true
-   **testfilter**: (REQUIRED) If testfilter returns true its value will be multiplied by the weight as final result
-   **inverttest**: Inverses the filter result

Subtag **ELSE**:   

-   **valuefilter**: If all all the testfilters failed, the return value is the value of the valuefilter multiplied by its weight
-   **value**: Value of the valuefilter
-   **weight**: Weight of the valuefilter
