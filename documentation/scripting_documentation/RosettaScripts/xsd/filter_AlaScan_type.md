Perform alanine scanning over a particular jump-defined interface, with a certain number of repeats with which to average results. Repacking is suggested.

```xml
<AlaScan name="(&string;)" interface_distance_cutoff="(&real;)"
        partner1="(&bool;)" partner2="(&bool;)" jump="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        repeats="(&non_negative_integer;)" symmetry="(&bool;)" repack="(&bool;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **interface_distance_cutoff**: Distance from chain 1 to define chain 2's interface, and vice versa
-   **partner1**: Perform alanine mutations on chain 1
-   **partner2**: Perform alanine mutations on chain 2
-   **jump**: An inter-chain jump over which the calculation is performed, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **repeats**: Number of repeats over which to average
-   **symmetry**: Assume a symmetric pose
-   **repack**: Repack in a radius around the mutated residue
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
