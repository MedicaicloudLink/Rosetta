Measures the distance between a sequence stored in pose commentsand the current sequence of pose. Useful together with SaveSequenceToCommentsMover.

```xml
<SequenceDistance name="(&string;)" sequence_comment_id="(&string;)"
        target_sequence="(&string;)" threshold="(1000 &non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **sequence_comment_id**: Name of sequence to load from pose comments
-   **target_sequence**: Specify a sequence to compare to
-   **threshold**: check only whether the comment exists or not, regardless of its content
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
