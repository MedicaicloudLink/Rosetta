This mover will modify a given task according to a sequence profile and then call the PackRotamersMover. At every position that is designable in the task, AAs that have a probability greater than min_aa_probability_ and higher than the native in the sequence profile will be allowed

```xml
<ConsensusDesignMover name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        invert_task="(true &bool;)" use_seqprof_constraints="(true &bool;)"
        sasa_cutoff="(1.0 &real;)"
        ignore_pose_profile_length_mismatch="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **invert_task**: Operate on the residues specified as non-packable in the PackerTask
-   **use_seqprof_constraints**: use sequence profile constraints
-   **sasa_cutoff**: skip designing residues with SASA lower than this
-   **ignore_pose_profile_length_mismatch**: If true, and the pose/profile mismatch, excess pose residues are marked repackable by SeqprofConsensusOperation.  If false, and they mismatch, it crashes.  If they match, no problems!
