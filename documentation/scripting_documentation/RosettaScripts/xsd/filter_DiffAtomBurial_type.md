This filter compares the SASA upon ligand binding for two different atoms

<DiffAtomBurial name="(&string;)" res1_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res1_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)"

```

-   **res1_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res1_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **res2_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res2_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **atomname1**: name of atom 1 (given as a string); defaults to CA on res1
-   **atomname2**: name of atom 2 (given as a string); defaults to CA on res2
-   **sample_type**: can be either 'more' (atom1 less than atom2) or 'less' (atom1 less than atom2
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
