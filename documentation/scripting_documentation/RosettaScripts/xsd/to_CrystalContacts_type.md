Exclude crystal contacts from design.

```xml
<CrystalContacts name="(&string;)" all_gap="(0.5 &real;)"
        polar_gap="(2.5 &real;)" max_buried_sasa="(0.01 &real;)"
        invert="(false &bool;)" nbr_radius_to_nbr_radius="(false &bool;)"
        nbr_radius_to_atoms="(true &bool;)" atoms_to_atoms="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **all_gap**: add this to all calculated distances
-   **polar_gap**: if either residue is polar - add this to calculated distances
-   **max_buried_sasa**: ignore buried residues as defined by maximum allowed sasa
-   **invert**: design residues in contact
-   **nbr_radius_to_nbr_radius**: contact determined by nbr radius overlap. CBeta to CBeta
-   **nbr_radius_to_atoms**: contact determined by nbr radius to atom distance. CBeta to any atom on symmetric partner
-   **atoms_to_atoms**: contact determined by atom to atom distances. Any atom to any atom.
