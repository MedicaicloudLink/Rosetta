Check if atom of interest has exactly n_partners Hbonds

```xml
<SimpleHbondsToAtomFilter name="(&string;)" n_partners="(1 &positive_integer;)"
        target_atom_name="(&string;)" hb_e_cutoff="(-0.5 &real;)"
        pdb_num="(&residue_number;)" res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **n_partners**: Number of partners expected to be Hbonding to tatget atom.
-   **target_atom_name**: Atom of interest involved in Hbonding.
-   **hb_e_cutoff**: Energy of Hbond cutoff.
-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
