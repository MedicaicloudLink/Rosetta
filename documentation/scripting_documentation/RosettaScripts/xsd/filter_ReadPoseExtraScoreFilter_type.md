This filter does no scoring, just looks for extra score terms previously placed in the pose object.

```xml
<ReadPoseExtraScoreFilter name="(&string;)" term_name="(&string;)"
        threshold="(&real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **term_name**: (REQUIRED) Name of the extra score term being searched for
-   **threshold**: (REQUIRED) If that energy is less than or equal to this threshold, returns true.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
