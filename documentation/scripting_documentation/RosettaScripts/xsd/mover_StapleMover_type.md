Design a stapled peptide at a protein interface

```xml
<StapleMover name="(&string;)" resnum="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        pdb_num="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        staple_gap="(4 &non_negative_integer;)" />
```

-   **resnum**: Residue number where the staple starts, in Rosetta or PDB or reference pose numbering
-   **pdb_num**: Residue number where the staple starts, in Rosetta or PDB or reference pose numbering
-   **staple_gap**: Gap from starting to ending stapled residue
