Calculates SASA for a set of residues defined by TaskOperations.

```xml
<TaskAwareSASA name="(&string;)" threshold="(0 &real;)"
        designable_only="(false &bool;)" sc_only="(false &bool;)"
        probe_radius="(2.2 &real;)" jump="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: Returns true if the set of residues defined by the TaskOperations have a combined SASA higher than the threshold, false otherwise. Default threshold is 0 so that all structures will pass if a threshold is not explicitly specified.
-   **designable_only**: If true, only designable positions are calculated...?
-   **sc_only**: Make backbone atoms virtual to find sidechain-only values?
-   **probe_radius**: Probe radius for calculating the solvent accessible surface area. Note: the default is larger than the typical used to represent water of 1.4 angstroms, but has been found to work well with the other default parameters for protein redesign purposes.
-   **jump**: If a jump has been provided by the user, separate the pose by that jump.
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
