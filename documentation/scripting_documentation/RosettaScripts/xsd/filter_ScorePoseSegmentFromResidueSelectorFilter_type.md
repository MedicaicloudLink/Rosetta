Applies the provided score function only to the selected region and adds the score to the pose. By default, it first individualizes the selected region and then scores it (this is ok, for example, to evaluate specific chains). By using the 'in_context' attribute, it just provides the score of the selected residuesReturns always True.

```xml
<ScorePoseSegmentFromResidueSelectorFilter name="(&string;)"
        in_context="(0 &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **in_context**: Do not individualize the selection before scoring.
-   **residue_selector**: (REQUIRED) Selector specifying the segment to be scored.
-   **scorefxn**: Score function to use for evaluation. If not specified calls Rosetta's default full atom score.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
