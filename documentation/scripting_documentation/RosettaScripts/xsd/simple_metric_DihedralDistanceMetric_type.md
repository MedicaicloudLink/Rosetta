Calculate DihedralDistance metric.
  This is the normalized metric in degrees
  Works on protein and carbohydrate backbones

 Metric described in:
   North B, Lehmann A, Dunbrack RL. A new clustering of antibody CDR loop conformations. J Mol Biol 2011;406:228-256.

```xml
<DihedralDistanceMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        include_omega="(false &bool;)" use_native="(false &bool;)"
        reference_name="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        residue_selector_ref="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **include_omega**: Do we include protein omega in calculations?  Default false.
-   **use_native**: Use the native if present on the cmd-line.
-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use (Use the SavePoseMover to create a reference pose)
-   **residue_selector**: Calculate the RMSD for these residues for both reference and main pose.
-   **residue_selector_ref**: Selector for the reference pose (input native or passed reference pose. ).  Residues selected must be same number of residues selected for the main selector.
