Counts the number of hydrophobic residues on the target that have at least a certain hydrophobic score

```xml
<InterfaceHydrophobicResidueContacts name="(&string;)"
        target_selector="(&string;)" binder_selector="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" threshold="(5 &integer;)"
        score_cut="(-0.5 &real;)"
        apolar_res="(ALA,CYS,CYD,PHE,ILE,LEU,MET,PRO,THR,VAL,TRP,TYR &string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **target_selector**: (REQUIRED) Which residues should be counted as hydrophobic target residues?
-   **binder_selector**: (REQUIRED) Which residues are part of the binder so that the interface can be defined?
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Which scorefunction do you want to use? Only fa_rep, fa_sol, and fa_atr will be kept.
-   **threshold**: How many hydrophobic residues should have at least the score cutoff?
-   **score_cut**: What score cut should be used to determine whether a hydrophobic residue is contacted?
-   **apolar_res**: What residues should count as hydrophobic residues (comma separated name3 list)?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
