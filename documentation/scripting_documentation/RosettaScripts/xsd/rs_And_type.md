---
The AndResidueSelector combines the output of multiple ResidueSelectors using AND logic, i.e., only residues selected by ALL contained ResidueSelectors will be selected. ResidueSelecters can be pulled in from a DataMap, from subtags (for ResidueSelectors known to the ResidueSelectorFactory) or programmatically through %add_residue_selector.

```xml
<And name="(&string;)" selectors="(&string;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</And>
```

-   **selectors**: Comma separated list of selected residues


"Residue Selector Tag": Any of the [[ResidueSelectors]]
