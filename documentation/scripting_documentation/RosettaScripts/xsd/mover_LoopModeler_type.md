Perform a complete loop modeling simulation, including the build, centroid, and fullatom steps. It is a wrapper around other modeling movers.

```

-   **loops_file**: path to loops file
-   **config**: Configure the local backbone move used in the refinement steps.If kic_with_frags is specified, -loops:frag_sizes and -loops:frag_files options are required.
-   **auto_refine**: Disable "auto_refine" if you wantto specify your own refinement moves
-   **scorefxn_fa**: Score function for full atom modeling.
-   **scorefxn_cen**: Score function for modeling in centroid representation.
-   **fast**: Only test run (fewer cycles)
-   **loophash_perturb_sequence**: Let LoopHashKIC also perturb the amino acid sequence
-   **loophash_seqposes_no_mutate**: Sequence positions that should not be mutated by LoopHashKIC.
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).


Subtag **Loop**:   Use this element to define a series of loops in subtags, one loop per subtag

-   **start**: (REQUIRED) The residue index (pose numbering) for the first position in the loop.
-   **stop**: (REQUIRED) The residue index (pose numbering) for the last position in the loop.
-   **cut**: The residue index (pose numbering) for the cutpoint residue (i.e. the cut residue will be the lower end of the chain break, and the cut+1 residue will be the upper end of the chain break). If a zero value is given, it will be interpretted as saying that the cutpoint should be chosen using the logic in protocols::loops::Loop::choose_cutpoint
-   **skip_rate**: The probability that you would like the loop will be skipped (such as by the IndependentLoopMover); a value less than zero means never skip, a value greater than one means always skip - NOT RESPECTED BY ALL PROTOCOLS
-   **rebuild**: If set to true, then the initial backbone dihedrals for the loop will be overwritten to produce an extended conformation (i.e. phi=-150 degres, psi=150, omego=180) and the bond angles and lengths will be idealized - NOT RESPECTED BY AL PROTOCOLS

Subtag **Build**:   Configure the build step. If "skip" is enabled, none of the loops will be rebuilt.You may also provide this tag with any option or subtag that would be understood by LoopBuilder.

-   **sfxn_cycles**: Number of iterations to make in the sfxn loop.
-   **mover_cycles**: The number of iterations to make in the mover loop
-   **ramp_rama**: If enabled, the Ramachandran weight will start near zero and will finish at whatever it was in the original score function.
-   **ramp_rep**: If enabled, the repulsive weight will start near zero andwill finish at whatever it was in the original score function
-   **ramp_down_cst**: If enabled, the constraint weight will start at whatever value in the scorefunction and end at 0.
-   **ramp_temp**: Ramp the temperature during the temp loop.
-   **initial_temp**: Initial temperature. Ignored if temperature ramping is disabled.
-   **final_temp**: Final temperature. Ignored if temperature ramping is disabled.
-   **skip**: If "skip" is enabled, the corresponding step will be skipped

Subtag **Centroid**:   Configure the centroid refinement step. If "skip" is enabled, none of the loops will be rebuilt. You may also provide this tag with any option or subtag that would be understood by LoopProtocol.

-   **sfxn_cycles**: Number of iterations to make in the sfxn loop.
-   **mover_cycles**: The number of iterations to make in the mover loop
-   **ramp_rama**: If enabled, the Ramachandran weight will start near zero and will finish at whatever it was in the original score function.
-   **ramp_rep**: If enabled, the repulsive weight will start near zero andwill finish at whatever it was in the original score function
-   **ramp_down_cst**: If enabled, the constraint weight will start at whatever value in the scorefunction and end at 0.
-   **ramp_temp**: Ramp the temperature during the temp loop.
-   **initial_temp**: Initial temperature. Ignored if temperature ramping is disabled.
-   **final_temp**: Final temperature. Ignored if temperature ramping is disabled.
-   **skip**: If "skip" is enabled, the corresponding step will be skipped

Subtag **Fullatom**:   Configure the centroid refinement step. If "skip" is enabled, none of the loops will be rebuilt. You may also provide this tag with any option or subtag that would be understood by LoopProtocol.

-   **sfxn_cycles**: Number of iterations to make in the sfxn loop.
-   **mover_cycles**: The number of iterations to make in the mover loop
-   **ramp_rama**: If enabled, the Ramachandran weight will start near zero and will finish at whatever it was in the original score function.
-   **ramp_rep**: If enabled, the repulsive weight will start near zero andwill finish at whatever it was in the original score function
-   **ramp_down_cst**: If enabled, the constraint weight will start at whatever value in the scorefunction and end at 0.
-   **ramp_temp**: Ramp the temperature during the temp loop.
-   **initial_temp**: Initial temperature. Ignored if temperature ramping is disabled.
-   **final_temp**: Final temperature. Ignored if temperature ramping is disabled.
-   **skip**: If "skip" is enabled, the corresponding step will be skipped
