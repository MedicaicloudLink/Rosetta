Associated with GenericMonteCarlo and MonteCarloTest. Recover a pose from a GenericMonteCarloMover. Useful in conjunction with MonteCarloRecover (below) if you're running a trajectory consisting of many different sorts of movers, and would like at each point to decide whether the pose has made an improvement.

```xml
<MonteCarloRecover name="(&string;)" MC_name="(&string;)"
        recover_low="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **MC_name**: name of a previously defined GenericMonteCarloMover
-   **recover_low**: recover the lowest-energy pose, or the last pose.
