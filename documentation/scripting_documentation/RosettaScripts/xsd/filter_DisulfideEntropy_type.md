Computes the change in deltaSconf_folding caused by formation of the disulfide bonds in a given topology. S_conf refers to the configurational entropy of the protein chain only.

```xml
<DisulfideEntropy name="(&string;)" tightness="(0 &real;)"
        lower_bound="(0 &real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **tightness**: Larger values for tightness lead to a higher (and thus looser) threshold.
-   **lower_bound**: Fixed threshold
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
