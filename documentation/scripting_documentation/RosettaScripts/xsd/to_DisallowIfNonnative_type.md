Restrict design to not include a residue as an possibility in the task at a position unless it is the starting residue.

```xml
<DisallowIfNonnative name="(&string;)" resnum="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        disallow_aas="(&string;)" />
```

-   **resnum**: If resnum is left as 0, the restriction will apply throughout the pose.
-   **disallow_aas**: Disallow_aas takes a string of one letter amino acid codes, no separation needed. For example disallow_aas=GCP would prevent Gly, Cys, and Pro from being designed unless they were the native amino acid at a position.
