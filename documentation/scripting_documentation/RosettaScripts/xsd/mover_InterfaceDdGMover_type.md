This mover reports the change in binding affinity (ddG) after mutation in the interface

```xml
<InterfaceDdGMover name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        jump="(&positive_integer;)" chain_num="(&positive_integer_cslist;)"
        chain_name="(&chain_cslist;)" mut_ref_savepose_mover="(&string;)"
        wt_ref_savepose_mover="(&string;)" db_reporter="(&string;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **jump**: jump that connects two sides of the interface
-   **chain_num**: comma separated list (or just one) chain number(s) that defines one side of the interface
-   **chain_name**: comma separated list (or just one) name/letter of chain(s) that defines one side of the interface
-   **mut_ref_savepose_mover**: name of previously defined SavePoseMover that has stored the mutant Pose
-   **wt_ref_savepose_mover**: name of previously defined SavePoseMover that has stored the wildtype Pose
-   **db_reporter**: name of previously defined db_report mover. Reporter (and its associated features) will be run on the bound mutant, bound wildtype, unbound mutant, and unbound wildtype states
