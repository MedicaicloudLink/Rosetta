Generates residue type constraints (either to native or to a specific residue type) for the specified residues

```xml
<ResidueTypeConstraintGenerator name="(&string;)"
        favor_native_bonus="(1.0 &real;)" rsd_type_name3="(&string;)"
        use_native="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **favor_native_bonus**: Unweighted score bonus the pose will receive for having the specified residue type at the specified position
-   **rsd_type_name3**: Three-letter code for the amino acid to which you want to constrain this residue. If unspecified, this defaults to the native amino acid at this position.
-   **use_native**: Use native structure (provided with in:file:native) as reference pose for defining desired residue identities
-   **residue_selector**: Selector specifying residues to be constrained. When not provided, all residues are selected
