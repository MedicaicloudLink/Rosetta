Specific to seeded abinitio protocol. Finds loops after seeded abinitio that should be closed.

```xml
<DefineMovableLoops name="(&string;)" add_chainbreakterm="(1 &bool;)"
        cutpoint_based="(1 &bool;)" secstrct="(&string;)"
        template_pdb="(&string;)" chain_num="(&string;)" >
    <Seeds begin="(&string;)" end="(&string;)" />
</DefineMovableLoops>
```

-   **add_chainbreakterm**: Penalize chain breaks.
-   **cutpoint_based**: Use cutpoint in loop modeling.
-   **secstrct**: File containg sec struct assignments for all residues in "chain_num"
-   **template_pdb**: Template pdb file
-   **chain_num**: Comma-separated list of chain IDs. NOTE: chains have to be consecutive


Subtag **Seeds**:   

-   **begin**: (REQUIRED) First residue of seed fragment.
-   **end**: (REQUIRED) Last residue of seed fragment.
