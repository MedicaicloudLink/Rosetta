Set a list of cysteine pairs to form disulfides and repack their surroundings. Useful for cases where the disulfides aren't recognized by Rosetta. By default the specified disulfides will be added to the existing set of disulfides.

```xml
<ForceDisulfides name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        disulfides="(&colon_sep_respair_cslist;)"
        remove_existing="(false &bool;)" repack="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **disulfides**: For instance: 23A:88A,22B:91B. Can also take regular Rosetta (aka Pose) numbering as in: 24:88,23:91.
-   **remove_existing**: Remove all existing disulfides before applying the new ones.
-   **repack**: Repack residues around the added/removed disulfides?
