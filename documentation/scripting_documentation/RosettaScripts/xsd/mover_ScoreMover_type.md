This Mover applies the scorefunction to your pose

```xml
<ScoreMover name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" verbose="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Score function to use when scoring this pose. Must be previously defined in the DataMap. Calls ScoreFunctionFactory with an empty string by default, which is either a good default or NULL
-   **verbose**: boolean controls a bunch of extra output - pose.energies.show() and something called a jd2:ScoreMap
