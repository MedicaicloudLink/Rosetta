-   **probability_type**: How probabilities are calculated: BOLTZMANN_SUM -- A simple boltzmann sum defined by 1/SUM( e^( -(score - score_0)/temp ) ), where score_0 is the score with the rotamer in the input pose. The score of the input pose is included in this sum, and therefore it can range from (0, 1]. All rotamers not in the input pose are essentially considered equally "far" from the input. PNEAR -- Probability of being near the input state, using a Gaussian to define nearness in sidechain heavy atom RMSD to the input state as proposed by Vikram Mulligan in the Baker Lab. The lambda parameter defines the width of the Gaussian. For a lambda of 0.5, a rotamer with sidechain RMSD of 0.5 will be scored as as half "near" and half "far" from the input state. PNEAR is defined as NUMERATOR/DENOMINATOR, where NUMERATOR = SUM( e^(-rms^2/lambda^2)*e(-(score - score_0)/temp) ), and DENOMINATOR = SUM( e^( -(score - score_0)/temp ).
-   **score_type**: The method used to combine the rotamer probabilities into the single number reported by the filter. Available score types are: MEAN_PROBABILITY -- Returns the mean of all computed probabilities. MAX_PROBABILITY -- Returns the maximum of all computed probabilities. MIN_PROBABILITY -- Returns the minimum of all computed probabilities. PROBABILITY -- Returns the product of all computed probabilities. MODIFIED_DDG -- Returns a ddG value weighted by the rotamer probabilities as described in Fleishman et al. (2011) Protein Sci. 20:753.
-   **lambda**: The "lambda" value to be used in computing "nearness" to the input state during rotamer probability calculation. This is only used if "PNEAR" is the probability method.
-   **temperature**: The temperature to be used in computing rotamer probabilities
-   **residue_selector**: XRW TO DO
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
