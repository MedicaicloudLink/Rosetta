Calculates the all atom RMSD for a single residue, either with or without the backbone atoms. The RMSD calculated is the automorphic RMSD, so it will compensate for symmetric rearrangments. (For example, Phe ring flips.) No superposition is performed prior to rmsd calculation.

```xml
<SidechainRmsd name="(&string;)" threshold="(1.0 &real;)"
        include_backbone="(false &bool;)" res1_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res1_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        res2_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res2_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)" reference_name="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: In a truth value context, what's the maximum RMSD value which is considered to be passing.
-   **include_backbone**: Whether to include the backbone in the RMSD calculation. It is recommended to set this to 'true' for ligands and other residues which don't have a backbone.
-   **res1_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res1_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **res2_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res2_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use (Use the SavePoseMover to create a reference pose)
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
