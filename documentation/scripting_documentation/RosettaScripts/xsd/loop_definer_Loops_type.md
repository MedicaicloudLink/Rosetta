Use this element to define a series of loops in subtags, one loop per subtag

```xml
<Loops name="(&string;)" >
    <loop start="(&non_negative_integer;)" stop="(&non_negative_integer;)"
            cut="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" skip_rate="(0.0 &real;)"
            extended="(false &bool;)" />
</Loops>
```



Subtag **loop**:   

-   **start**: (REQUIRED) The residue index (pose numbering) for the first position in the loop.
-   **stop**: (REQUIRED) The residue index (pose numbering) for the last position in the loop.
-   **cut**: The residue index (pose numbering) for the cutpoint residue (i.e. the cut residue will be the lower end of the chain break, and the cut+1 residue will be the upper end of the chain break). If a zero value is given, it will be interpretted as saying that the cutpoint should be chosen using the logic in protocols::loops::Loop::choose_cutpoint
-   **skip_rate**: The probability that you would like the loop will be skipped by the IndependentLoopMover; a value less than zero means never skip, a value greater than one means always skip
-   **extended**: If set to true, then the initial backbone dihedrals for the loop will be overwritten to produce an extended conformation (i.e. phi=-150 degres, psi=150, omego=180) and the bond angles and lengths will be idealized
