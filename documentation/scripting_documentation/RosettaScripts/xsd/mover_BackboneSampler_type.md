Adapted from the protein interface design backrub mover. Mover that makes a given number of Monte Carlo steps attempting backrub-like Gaussian backbone moves to the provided protein. May be used to generate an ensemble of backbones.

```xml
<BackboneSampler name="(&string;)" moves="(1000 &non_negative_integer;)"
        kT="(0.6 &real;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **moves**: number of backbone moves to make
-   **kT**: Temperature parameter (kT) for Monte Carlo sampling
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
