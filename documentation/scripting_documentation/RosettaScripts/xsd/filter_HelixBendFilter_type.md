This filter will check each helix turn in target HelixID helix for further-than-optimal Hbond pairs and curvature below (smaller angles) than cutoff, it reports the minimum angle value. If no secondary structure string or blueprint are provided, then the pose secstruct is parsed using DSSP.

```xml
<HelixBendFilter name="(&string;)" threshold="(155.0 &real;)"
        HelixID="(1 &positive_integer;)" blueprint="(&string;)"
        secstruct="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: Minimum bending angle allowed.
-   **HelixID**: Helix number over which to calculate bend and Hbond pair distance according to blueprint numbers
-   **blueprint**: Path to blueprint file from which to parse strands
-   **secstruct**: Secondary structure string to use for selecting helices
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
