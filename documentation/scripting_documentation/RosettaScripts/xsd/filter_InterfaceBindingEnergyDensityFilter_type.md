Takes two other filters: Ddg and Sasa. Computes Ddg/Sasa and returns the value. Fails if the value is not below some threshold.

```xml
<InterfaceBindingEnergyDensityFilter name="(&string;)" sasa_filter="(&string;)"
        ddG_filter="(&string;)" threshold="(-0.015 &real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **sasa_filter**: (REQUIRED) the name of a previously defined Sasa filter
-   **ddG_filter**: (REQUIRED) the name of a previously defined Ddg filter
-   **threshold**: sets the fail condition for the filter, this filter fails if Ddg/Sasa is not below the threshold.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
