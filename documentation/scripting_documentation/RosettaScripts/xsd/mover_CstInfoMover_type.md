Report information about how well the pose reflects given constraint values

```xml
<CstInfoMover name="(&string;)" cst_file="(&string;)" dump_cst_file="(&string;)"
        prefix="(CST &string;)" recursive="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **cst_file**: Which constraints to report. If not given (or given as an empty string), report on the constraints that are currently in the pose. For consistency between different structures, it's highly recommended to supply a constraints file. In-pose constraints are not stored in any defined order, there's no guarantee that the constraint numbering will match up structure-to-structure, even if every pose has identical constraints. (If a constraint file is used, the order of the constraints will be the same as the order of the constraints in the constraint file.)
-   **dump_cst_file**: File name to WRITE the constraints into. Constraints are only printed if a file  name is provided
-   **prefix**: What prefix to give the values. Important if you have more than one CstInfoMover (or more than one application), as later values with the same prefix will overwrite earlier values.
-   **recursive**: Should sub-constraints of a multi-constraint also be output
