XRW TO DO

```xml
<RotLibOut name="(&string;)" min_frag_len="(&string;)" min_dist="(3 &real;)"
        dump_pdb="(false &bool;)" rotamer_db_filename="(&string;)"
        sequence_alignment_filename="(&string;)" />
```

-   **min_frag_len**: Set minimum fragment length to use in alignmnet
-   **min_dist**: Minimum distance between aligned residues
-   **dump_pdb**: for debuging, whether to dump pdbs during run
-   **rotamer_db_filename**: Path to save rotamer db file
-   **sequence_alignment_filename**: file name to save sequence alignment between pose and input pdbs.
