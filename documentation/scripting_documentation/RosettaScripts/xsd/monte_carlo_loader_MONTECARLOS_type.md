Data loader for MonteCarlo objects that can be created and then added to the data map so that they could be shared between multiple movers, if desired; superceded by the GenericMonteCarlo mover, and I believe, currently unused by any mover

```xml
<MONTECARLOS >
    <MonteCarlo name="(&string;)" temperature="(2.0 &real;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" />
</MONTECARLOS>
```



Subtag **MonteCarlo**:   

-   **temperature**: The temperature for the MonteCarlo object to operate at, interpretted in units of kT (e.g. 0.6 = room temperature)
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
