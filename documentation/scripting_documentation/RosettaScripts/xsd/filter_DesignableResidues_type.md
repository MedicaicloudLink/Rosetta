Filters based on minimum and maximum number of designable residues allowed; useful for automatic interface detection

```xml
<DesignableResidues name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)"
        lower_cutoff="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        upper_cutoff="(1000 &non_negative_integer;)" packable="(0 &bool;)"
        designable="(0 &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **lower_cutoff**: This option presently has no effect.
-   **upper_cutoff**: This option presently has no effect.
-   **packable**: Determine all packable positions
-   **designable**: Determine all designable positions
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
