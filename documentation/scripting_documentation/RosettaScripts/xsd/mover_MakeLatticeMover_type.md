If you wish to model a structure in its crystal lattice, a symmetry definition file is not needed. Rather, one can use the flag -symmetry_definition CRYST1.

```xml
<MakeLatticeMover name="(&string;)" contact_dist="(&real;)" />
```

-   **contact_dist**: Command line '-interaction_shell ##' OR XML 'contact_dist=##' specifies the distance (in Angstrom) away from the input structure to generate symmetric partners.
