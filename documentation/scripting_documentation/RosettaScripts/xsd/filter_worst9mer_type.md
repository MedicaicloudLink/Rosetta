Filters out structures that don't have good fragment RMSD at the worst position.

```xml
<worst9mer name="(&string;)" threshold="(99.0 &real;)"
        rmsd_lookup_threshold="(0.40 &real;)" only_helices="(false &bool;)"
        ignore_terminal_resiude="(true &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: filter threshold
-   **rmsd_lookup_threshold**: if the filtered threshold is not 99, the filtered threshold is equal to the rmsd_lookup_threshold; else it is the default value of 0.40
-   **only_helices**: look at only helices?
-   **ignore_terminal_resiude**: ignore the terminal residue?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
