Filter on the value of the angle between a vector between two atoms in the first residue of a chain and a reference vector.

```xml
<AngleToVector name="(&string;)" min_angle="(0.0 &real;)"
        max_angle="(90.0 &real;)" atm1="(&string;)" atm2="(&string;)"
        chain="(&char;)" refx="(&real;)" refy="(&real;)" refz="(&real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **min_angle**: Minimum angle to pass the filter
-   **max_angle**: Maximum angle to pass the filter
-   **atm1**: First atom in vector definition
-   **atm2**: Seocnd atom in vector definition
-   **chain**: Chain whose first residue's two atoms are in question
-   **refx**: x coordinate of vector
-   **refy**: y coordinate of vector
-   **refz**: z coordinate of vector
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
