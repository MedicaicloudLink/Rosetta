filters based upon whether the desired residue conformer is set

```xml
<ResidueConformerFilter name="(&string;)" restype="(&string;)"
        relevent_atoms="(&string;)"
        desired_conformer="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        seqpos="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" max_rms="(0.0 &real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **restype**: the type of residue to be used - must be set for this filter to work
-   **relevent_atoms**: comma seperated list of strings made up of the atom names to be used
-   **desired_conformer**: indicates which conformer to look at; if set to 0, the conformer used is the current conformer of the pose
-   **seqpos**: specific residue to be looked at; if set to 0, looks at all possible residues in pose
-   **max_rms**: maximum rsmd for the filter; initilized in the constructor to be 0.5; not sure why the parse_my_tag includes a default
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
