A scoring grid that treats selected residue atoms as both attractive within 4.75A (getting a default score of -1) and repulsive within 2.25A (getting a default score of +1) atr and rep changes scoring weights;

```xml
<SiteGrid name="(&string;)" grid_name="(&string;)" residues="(&string;)"
        atr="(-1.0 &real;)" rep="(1.0 &real;)" weight="(&real;)" />
```

-   **grid_name**: The name used to insert the scoring grid into the GridManager
-   **residues**: Residue numbers to add additional attractive or repulsive term
-   **atr**: Score for attractive term of grid (negative scoring is better)
-   **rep**: Score for repulsive term of grid (negative scoring is better)
-   **weight**: (REQUIRED) XRW TO DO
