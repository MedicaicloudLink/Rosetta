Returns true if the distance between 2 residues does not exceed the threshold

```xml
<ResidueDistance name="(&string;)" distance="(&real;)"
        res1_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res1_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        res2_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res2_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **distance**: Maximal distance between residue 1 and residue 2
-   **res1_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res1_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **res2_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res2_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
