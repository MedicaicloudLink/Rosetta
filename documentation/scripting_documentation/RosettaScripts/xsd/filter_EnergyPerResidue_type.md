Tests the energy of a particular residue (e.g. pdb_num=1), or interface (whole_interface=1), or whole protein (whole_protein=1), or a set of residues (e.g. resnums=1,2,3).

```xml
<EnergyPerResidue name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        score_type="(total_score &string;)" energy_cutoff="(0.0 &real;)"
        whole_interface="(0 &bool;)" whole_protein="(0 &bool;)"
        jump_number="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        interface_distance_cutoff="(8.0 &real;)" bb_bb="(false &bool;)"
        resnums="(&string;)" around_resnums="(&string;)"

```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **score_type**: score type
-   **energy_cutoff**: energy threshold
-   **whole_interface**: If whole_interface is set to 1, it computes all the energies for the interface residues defined by the jump_number and the interface_distance_cutoff
-   **whole_protein**: tests the energy of the interface if true
-   **jump_number**: The jump which describes the interface
-   **interface_distance_cutoff**: Along with the jump_number, it defines the residues on the interface
-   **bb_bb**: Needs to be set to true if you want to evaluate backbone-backbone hydrogen bonding energies
-   **resnums**: a list of residue numbers (1,2,3 for pose numbering or 1A,2A,3A for pdb numbering) to filter through
-   **around_resnums**: a list of residues that you want to evaluate the energy around
-   **around_shell**: distance measure that helps define the region to evaluate the energy
-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
