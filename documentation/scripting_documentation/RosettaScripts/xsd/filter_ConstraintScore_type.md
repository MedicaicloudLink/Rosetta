Computes the score of a specific set of constraints generated by Constraint Generators. This filter makes a copy of the pose and clears all constraints from the copy. It then uses the provided Constraint Generators to generate a set of constraints, and scores the pose using a basic scorefunction. This basic scorefunction consists only of constraint score terms.

```xml
<ConstraintScore name="(&string;)" threshold="(&real;)"
        constraint_generators="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: If the computed constraint score is less than or equal to this value, the filter returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
-   **constraint_generators**: ConstraintGenerators that define constraints for the pose
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
