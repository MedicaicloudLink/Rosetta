Cleans an alignment, such that all amino acids are measured in the same chemical environment

```xml
<AlignmentAAFinder name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        exclude_AA_threshold="(10 &real;)" alignment_file="(null &string;)"
        relax_mover="(null &string;)" loop_seqid_threshold="(0.50 &real;)"
        available_AAs_file="(null &string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **exclude_AA_threshold**: How large may the score be of the an amino acid in the target sequence
-   **alignment_file**: alignment_file to be cleaned
-   **relax_mover**: Relax mover
-   **loop_seqid_threshold**: Sequence identity threshold of indel motif matching loops
-   **available_AAs_file**: output path
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
