XRW TO DO

```xml
<DesignAround name="(&string;)" resnums="(&string;)" design_shell="(8.0 &real;)"
        allow_design="(true &bool;)" resnums_allow_design="(true &bool;)"
        repack_shell="(8.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **resnums**: (REQUIRED) can be a list of pdb numbers, such as 291B,101A.
-   **design_shell**: what sphere to design around the target residues. Must be at least as large as design_shell.
-   **allow_design**: allow design in the sphere, else restrict to repacking.
-   **resnums_allow_design**: allow design in the resnums list, else restrict to repacking.
-   **repack_shell**: what sphere to pack around the target residues. Must be at least as large as design_shell.
