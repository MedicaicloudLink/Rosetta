A mover for modeling docking via a LYX bond.

```xml
<UBQ_GTPaseMover name="(&string;)" UBQpdb="(&string;)"
        binding_lysine="(&string;)" extraBodies="(&xs:boolean;)"
        numTailRes="(&non_negative_integer;)" scorefilter="(&real;)"
        SASAfilter="(&real;)" lys_num="(&integer;)" />
```

-   **UBQpdb**: File path to UBQ pdb file
-   **binding_lysine**: A residue selector giving the lysine residue on the substrate to which UBQ will bind.
-   **extraBodies**: Whether there are extra bodies in the simulation.
-   **numTailRes**: Number of tail residues on the ubiquitin.
-   **scorefilter**: Filter for total score
-   **SASAfilter**: Filter for SASA
-   **lys_num**: An integer giving the lysine residue to which UBQ will bind. Use this or binding_lysine.
