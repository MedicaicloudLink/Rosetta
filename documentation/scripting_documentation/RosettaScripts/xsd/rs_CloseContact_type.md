---
This class selects all residues in close contact with a central residue, or a set of central residues, where this decision is based on atom-to-atom distances for the current set of coordinates in the Pose

```xml
<CloseContact name="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        contact_threshold="(4.5 &real;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</CloseContact>
```

-   **residue_selector**: The name of the residue selector that's used to identify the central residue(s); other residues are selected if they are in close contact with this group of central residues
-   **contact_threshold**: The distance, in Angstroms, around the residues in the central-residues set which defines the atomic-contact cutoff


"Residue Selector Tag": Any of the [[ResidueSelectors]]
