The JumpDownstreamSelector sets the positions corresponding to all of the residues that are downstream of the indicated jump to true, and all the other positions to false. This selector is logically equivalent to a NotSelector applied to the JumpUpstreamSelector for the same jump.

```xml
<JumpDownstream name="(&string;)" jump="(&integer;)" />
```

-   **jump**: (REQUIRED) The integer given for the "jump" argument should refer to a Jump that is present in the Pose.
