A string metric that generates a string of PyMol commands to colour a structure's polar groups based on burial.

```xml
<PolarGroupBurialPyMolStringMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        verbose="(false &bool;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **verbose**: If true, this metric outputs to tracer as well as to the pose.  False by default
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) A scorefunction, defined previously in the RosettaScripts XML, which will be used to extract the buried_unsaturated_penalty's definition of burial.  Required option.
