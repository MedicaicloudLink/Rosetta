XRW TO DO

```xml
<SwitchChainOrder name="(&string;)" chain_order="(&string;)"
        chain_num="(&nnegative_int_cslist;)" chain_name="(&chain_cslist;)"
        invert_chains="(false &bool;)" residue_numbers_setter="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **chain_order**: Order of final chains
-   **chain_num**: List of final chain positions, to be correlated to chain_name
-   **chain_name**: List of final chain names, to be correlated to chain_num
-   **invert_chains**: If true, apply on the inverse of chain selection (as specified in name or number options)
-   **residue_numbers_setter**: List of final chain names, to be correlated to chain_num
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
