A utility metric that outputs the residue selection in Pose or PDB numbering.  Comma-Separated.

```xml
<SelectedResiduesMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        rosetta_numbering="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **rosetta_numbering**: Set to output in Rosetta numbering instead of PDB numbering
-   **residue_selector**: Required.  Output those residues selected.
