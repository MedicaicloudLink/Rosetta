A metric for measuring ... and adding it to the resulting score file.

```xml
<SequenceMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        three_letter="(false &bool;)"
        output_mode="(oneletter &SequenceMetric_output_modes;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **three_letter**: DEPRECATED.  Use of this option will trigger a runtime error.  Use the output_mode option instead.
-   **output_mode**: The format for the sequence.  Allowed output formats are: oneletter, threeletter, basename, or fullname.
-   **residue_selector**: Output the sequence of only the selected residues.
