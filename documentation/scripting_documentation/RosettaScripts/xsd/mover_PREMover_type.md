This Mover converts PRE rates into CB-CB atom pair constraints and attaches them to the pose

```xml
<PREMover name="(&string;)" pre_input_file="(&string;)"
        minimize_w_csts="(false &bool;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        weighted_average="(false &bool;)" >
    <Histograms spinlabel="(&string;)" histogram_file="(&string;)"
            bin_size="(0.5 &real;)" />
</PREMover>
```

-   **pre_input_file**: (REQUIRED) PRE data input file
-   **minimize_w_csts**: Do one round of minimization with PRE distance constraints
-   **scorefxn**: Use this scorefunction when minimizing with PRE distance constraints
-   **weighted_average**: Calculate average distance from multiple PRE experiments for the same spinlabel site using single experiment weights


Subtag **Histograms**:   

-   **spinlabel**: (REQUIRED) Three-letter spinlabel code
-   **histogram_file**: (REQUIRED) Path to spinlabel histogram file used for transformation of PREs into CB-CB atom pair constraints
-   **bin_size**: Histogram bin size
