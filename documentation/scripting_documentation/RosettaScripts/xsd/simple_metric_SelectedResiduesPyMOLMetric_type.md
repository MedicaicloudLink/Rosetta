A utility metric that outputs the residue selection as a PyMOL selection.

```xml
<SelectedResiduesPyMOLMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **residue_selector**: Required.  Output those residues selected.
