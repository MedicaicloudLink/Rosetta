This mover allows a solution to a packer problem to be imported from an external file.  This allows Rosetta to communicate with external optimization packages, and provides a means of visualizing the result easily.

```xml
<ExternalPackerResultLoader name="(&string;)"
        packer_problem_definition_file="(&string;)"
        solution_definition_file="(&string;)" />
```

-   **packer_problem_definition_file**: The file from which a description of the packer problem will be loaded.
-   **solution_definition_file**: The file from which the solution to the packer problem will be loaded.
