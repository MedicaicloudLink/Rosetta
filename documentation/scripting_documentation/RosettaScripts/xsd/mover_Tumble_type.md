```xml
<Tumble name="(&string;)" chain_number="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        start_res="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        stop_res="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)" />
```

-   **chain_number**: The chain to tumble - not compatible with start_res/stop_res.
-   **start_res**: The first residue of the residue span to tumble - not compatible with chain_number.
-   **stop_res**: The last residue of the residue span to tumble - not compatible with chain_number.
