---
The AndJumpSelector combines the output of multiple JumpSelectors using AND logic, i.e., only jumps selected by ALL contained JumpSelectors will be selected. JumpSelecters can be pulled in from a DataMap, from subtags (for JumpSelectors known to the JumpSelectorFactory) or programmatically through %add_jump_selector.

```xml
<And name="(&string;)" selectors="(&string;)" >
    <Jump Selector Tag ... />
</And>
```

-   **selectors**: Comma separated list of selected jumps


"Jump Selector Tag": Any of the [[JumpSelectors]]
