Makes junctions from file

```xml
<MakeJunctionsMover name="(&string;)" pdb_cache="(true &bool;)"
        pdb_cache_max_size="(2000 &non_negative_integer;)" designs="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" junction_rmsd_thresh="(1.5 &real;)" />
```

-   **pdb_cache**: caches the junctions/DHR as required during runtime
-   **pdb_cache_max_size**: max number of pdbs to save in cache.
-   **designs**: (REQUIRED) File with one design per line
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Score function used for packing and design.
-   **junction_rmsd_thresh**: Not all junctions are perfectly identical structurally. in the first junction. This sets a threshold for allowed difference.
