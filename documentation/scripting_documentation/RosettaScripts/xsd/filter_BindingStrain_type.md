Computes the energetic strain in a bound monomer. Automatically respects symmetry

```xml
<BindingStrain name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" threshold="(3.0 &real;)"
        relax_mover="(null &string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **jump**: Jump across which to compute binding
-   **threshold**: Strain must be less than this value to pass
-   **relax_mover**: Relax mover employed to relieve the unbound state
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
