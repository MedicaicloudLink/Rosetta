Add mhc epitope constraints from the provided file to the selected region or whole pose.

```xml
<AddMHCEpitopeConstraintMover name="(&string;)" filename="(&string;)"
        selector="(&string;)" weight="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **filename**: (REQUIRED) Name of mhc epitope constraint file.  (These files have a ".mhc" suffix).
-   **selector**: Residue selector named somewhere else in the script.  If provided, the mhc epitope score of the selected region is constrained; otherwise the global score is constrained.
-   **weight**: Adjust the mhc_epitope weight for the epitope predictor set up by this constraint mover ONLY.  The weight will be the mhc_epitope weight of the scorefunction * this weight.
