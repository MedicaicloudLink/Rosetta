Computes the SASA for each hydrophobic residue (A, F, I, M, L, W, V, Y). The score returned reflects both the number of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues and the degree to which they are exposed. The score is calculated as follows. For each hydrophobic residue, if the SASA is above a certain cutoff value (default=20), then the value of ( SASA - sasa_cutoff ) is added to the calculated score. The filter passes if the calculated score is less than the user-specified threshold.

```xml
<ExposedHydrophobics name="(&string;)" sasa_cutoff="(&real;)"
        threshold="(&real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **sasa_cutoff**: If a residue has SASA lower than this value, it is considered buried and does not affect the score returned by the ExposedHydrophobics filter.
-   **threshold**: If a protein has an ExposedHydrophobics total score below this value, it passes the filter. If a negative threshold is specified, the filter will always pass.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
