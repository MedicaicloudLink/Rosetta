Restrict design to user-specified residues. If resnum is left as 0, the restriction will apply throughout the pose.

```xml
<RestrictAbsentCanonicalAAS name="(&string;)"
        resnum="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" keep_aas="(&string;)" />
```

-   **resnum**: Restrict design to user-specified residues. If =0, all residues.
-   **keep_aas**: Canonical amino acids to keep.
