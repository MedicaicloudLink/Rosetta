filters energies where ligand is in the interface

```xml
<LigInterfaceEnergy name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        energy_cutoff="(0.0 &real;)" include_cstE="(0 &bool;)"
        jump_number="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        interface_distance_cutoff="(8.0 &real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **energy_cutoff**: energy threshold for filter
-   **include_cstE**: boolean as to whether to include the cstE
-   **jump_number**: If rb_jump_ is unset, determine jump number according to the number of jumps currently in the pose previously, if this filter was used in RosettaScripts, rb_jump_ was initialized to jump number according to the number of jumps in the pose when the XML was parsed. This enables adding a ligand to the pose after the XML is parsed
-   **interface_distance_cutoff**: used to determine if the ligand is in the interface?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
