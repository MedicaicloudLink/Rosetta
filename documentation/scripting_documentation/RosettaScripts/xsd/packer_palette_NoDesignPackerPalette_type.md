Sets up an empty packer palette, specifying no residues, with no user-configurable options.  This restricts the packer to repacking.  Note that this behaviour can be achieved with the RestrictToRepacking task operation, but doing this with the PackerPalette can be preferable since it means that, under the hood, we're not unnecessarily setting up a list of ResidueTypes only to delete them all.

```xml
<NoDesignPackerPalette name="(&string;)" />
```
