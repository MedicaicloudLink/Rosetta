XRW TO DO

```xml
<AtomicContact name="(&string;)" distance="(4.0 &real;)" range1="(&string;)"
        residue1="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        residue2="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)" sidechain="(&bool;)"
        backbone="(&bool;)" protons="(&bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **distance**: Distance below which a contact counts
-   **range1**: Space-separated pair of integers indicating the first residue range over which to evaluate the filter
-   **residue1**: Residue number that may be making atomic contacts with residue2; only read if range1 is not provided
-   **residue2**: Residue number that may be making atomic contacts with the range of residues range1
-   **sidechain**: Count sidechain contacts
-   **backbone**: Count contacts to the backbone
-   **protons**: Count contacts made by protons
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
