This directory contains the auto-generated documentation fragments from the in-code XSD definitions.

These files can be autogenerated from the XSD schema output by `-parser::output_schema` with the
Rosetta/tools/doc_tools/xsd_to_doc_fragments.py script.

The pages in here aren't meant to be linked to directly, instead, they should be combined 
with the manually written documentation by using the Gollum inclusion syntax:

    [[include:mover_PackRotamersMover_type]]

Don't put any non-autogenerated files in this directory (well, except this NOTES.txt file),
as we'll occasionally delete the entire contents, to remove any documentation fragments
which are for RosettaScripts entities which no longer exist.
