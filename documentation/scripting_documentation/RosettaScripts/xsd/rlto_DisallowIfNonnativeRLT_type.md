Restrict design to not include a residue as an possibility in the task at a position unless it is the starting residue. If resnum is left as 0, the restriction will apply throughout the pose.

```xml
<DisallowIfNonnativeRLT name="(&string;)" disallow_aas="(&string;)" />
```

-   **disallow_aas**: (REQUIRED) takes a string of one letter amino acid codes, no separation needed. For example disallow_aas=GCP would prevent Gly, Cys, and Pro from being designed unless they were the native amino acid at a position.This task is useful when you are designing in a region that has Gly and Pro and you do not want to include them at other positions that aren't already Gly or Pro.
