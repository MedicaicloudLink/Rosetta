Computes the interaction energy between 2 groups of residues: 1. a set of residues and 2. all residues on a given chain.

```xml
<ResidueSetChainEnergy name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        score_type="(total_score &string;)" threshold="(&real;)"
        resnums="(&string;)" chain="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **score_type**: what scoreing type to use
-   **threshold**: (REQUIRED) filter threshold
-   **resnums**: (REQUIRED) Group1 is defined with resnums, a list of residue numbers (1,2,3 for pose numbering or 1A,2A,3A for pdb numbering).
-   **chain**: Group2 is defined with chain, which is the rosetta chain number.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
