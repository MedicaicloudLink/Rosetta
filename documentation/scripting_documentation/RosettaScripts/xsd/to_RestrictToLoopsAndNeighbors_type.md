A TaskOp that restricts packing and/or design to the loops specified and optionally the neighbors.

```xml
<RestrictToLoopsAndNeighbors name="(&string;)" design="(&bool;)"
        restrict_only_design_to_loops="(&bool;)" loops_file="(&string;)"
        include_neighbors="(&bool;)" design_neighbors="(&bool;)"
        cutoff_dist="(&real;)" />
```

-   **design**: XRW TO DO
-   **restrict_only_design_to_loops**: XRW TO DO
-   **loops_file**: XRW TO DO
-   **include_neighbors**: Should we include neighbors?
-   **design_neighbors**: Should we design neighbors?  Default False.
-   **cutoff_dist**: Distance for neighbor detection. default 10.0
