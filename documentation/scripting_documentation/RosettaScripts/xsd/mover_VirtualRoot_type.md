Reroot the pose foldtree on a (new) virtual residue. Useful for minimization in the context of absolute frames (coordinate constraints, electron density information, etc.) By default, the mover will add a virtual root residue to the pose if one does not already exist. If you wish to later remove the virtual root, add the root with a mover with removable set to true, and then later use a separate VirtualRoot mover with remove set to true to remove it.

```xml
<VirtualRoot name="(&string;)" remove="(&bool;)" removable="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **remove**: Removes the virtual root from the pose. Useful for subsequent use to a previous VirtualRoot call
-   **removable**: Set this to true of you want the virtual root to be removable. See remove option.
