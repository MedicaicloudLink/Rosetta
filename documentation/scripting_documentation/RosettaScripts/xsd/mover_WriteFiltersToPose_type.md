Takes results from any filters and writes them to the end of the pose file.

```xml
<WriteFiltersToPose name="(&string;)" prefix="(&string;)"
        include_type="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **prefix**: Prefix to append to report output, so you can have multiple WriteFiltersToPose instances at different points in your RosettaScripts and not have them overwrite each other.
-   **include_type**: Include the filter type in your output (whether you want this depends on how you are parsing the pose files).
