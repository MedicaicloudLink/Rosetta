This mover functions to thread the sequence of a region onto the given pose. Nothing fancy here. Useful when combined with -parser:string_vars option to replace strings within the RosettaScript. For more a more fancy comparative modeling protocol, please see the lovely RosettaCM

```xml
<SimpleThreadingMover name="(&string;)" pack_neighbors="(false &bool;)"
        neighbor_dis="(6.0 &real;)" start_position="(&string;)"
        thread_sequence="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        skip_unknown_mutant="(&bool;)" pack_rounds="(5 &positive_integer;)" />
```

-   **pack_neighbors**: Option to pack neighbors while threading
-   **neighbor_dis**: Distance to repack neighbor side chains. Repack shell distance for each threaded residue
-   **start_position**: (REQUIRED) Position to start thread. PDB numbering (like 30L) or Rosetta pose numbering. PDB numbering parsed at apply time to allow for pose-length changes prior to apply of this mover
-   **thread_sequence**: (REQUIRED) One letter amino acid sequence we will be grafting. Currently only works for canonical amino acids
-   **scorefxn**: Optional Scorefunction name passed - setup in score function block
-   **skip_unknown_mutant**: Skip unknown amino acid in thread_sequence string instead of throwing an exception
-   **pack_rounds**: Number of packing rounds for threading.  Must be at least 1 so that substitutions are applied.
