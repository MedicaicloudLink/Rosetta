XRW TO DO

```xml
<HotspotDisjointedFoldTree name="(&string;)" ddG_threshold="(1.0 &real;)"
        chain="(2 &non_negative_integer;)" radius="(8.0 &real;)"
        resnums="(&resnum_list_with_ranges;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **ddG_threshold**: Threshold to categorize residues as hotspots by ddG
-   **chain**: Chain with hotspots of interest, identified by sequentially numbering
-   **radius**: Radius around which to calculate the local interface
-   **resnums**: List of residue numbers to use
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
