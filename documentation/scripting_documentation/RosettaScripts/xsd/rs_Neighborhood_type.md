A Residue Selector that selects neighboring residues to a set of residues (focus).  By default, includes this focus in the resulting selection.

```xml
<Neighborhood name="(&string;)" selector="(&string;)" resnums="(&string;)"
        distance="(&real;)" atom_names_for_distance_measure="(&string;)"
        include_focus_in_subset="(true &bool;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</Neighborhood>
```

-   **selector**: Focus to select around.
-   **resnums**: Focus to select around.
-   **distance**: Distance to measure neighbors. Default is 10A.
-   **atom_names_for_distance_measure**: A list of comma separated atom names, for each focus residue, the positions of which will be used for measuring distance to find neighbors.
-   **include_focus_in_subset**: Should the focus be included in the returning subset?  Default True


"Residue Selector Tag": Any of the [[ResidueSelectors]]
