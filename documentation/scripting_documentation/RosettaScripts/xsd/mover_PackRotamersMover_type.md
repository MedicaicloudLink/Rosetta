```xml
<PackRotamersMover name="(&string;)" nloop="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" />
```

-   **nloop**: Equivalent to "-ndruns".Number of complete packing runs before an output (best score) is produced.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
