Takes a set of task operations from the user in order to more precisely specify a set of residues to analyze via ddG scanning. Individually mutates each of the residues to alanine (or whatever other residue is defined in the task operations) and calculates the change in binding energy (ddG).

```xml
<DdGScan name="(&string;)" repeats="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        report_diffs="(1 &bool;)" ddG_mover="(&string;)" write2pdb="(0 &bool;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **repeats**: How many times to repeat the ddg calculations; the average of all the repeats is returned.
-   **report_diffs**: Whether to report the changes in binding energy upon mutation (pass true), or the total binding energy for the mutated structure (pass false).
-   **ddG_mover**: Handle definition of a special ddG mover.
-   **write2pdb**: Whether to write the residue-specific ddG information to the output .pdb file.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
