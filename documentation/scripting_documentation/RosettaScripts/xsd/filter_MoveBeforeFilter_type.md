Apply a given mover to the pose before calculating the results from another filter. Note that, like all filters, MoveBeforeFilter cannot change the input pose - the results of the submover will only be used for the subfilter calculation and then discarded.

```xml
<MoveBeforeFilter name="(&string;)" mover="(&string;)" mover_name="(&string;)"
        filter="(&string;)" filter_name="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **mover**: Name of the mover to be applied in advance of filter execution
-   **mover_name**: Name of the mover to be applied in advance of filter execution
-   **filter**: Filter succeeded by the mover
-   **filter_name**: Filter succeeded by the mover
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
