A scoring grid that contains PCS values which are calculated from the input tensor and compared with the ligand PCS values.

```xml
<PCSSingleGrid name="(&string;)" grid_name="(&string;)" tensor="(&real_cslist;)"
        pcs_file="(&string;)" pcs_weight="(1.0 &real;)" weight="(&real;)" />
```

-   **grid_name**: The name used to insert the scoring grid into the GridManager.
-   **tensor**: (REQUIRED) Comma-separated list of PCS tensor values from which the PCSSingleGrid is calculated. Tensor values should have the following order: Xax, Xrh, xM, yM, zM, alpha, beta, gamma.
-   **pcs_file**: (REQUIRED) Textfile with ligand PCS values.
-   **pcs_weight**: Multiply the PCS grid score by this weight value.
-   **weight**: (REQUIRED) XRW TO DO
