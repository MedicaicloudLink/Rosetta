What is the average degree connectivity of a subset of residues? Found to be useful for discriminating non-interacting designs from natural complexes.

```xml
<AverageDegree name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" threshold="(0 &real;)"
        distance_threshold="(8.0 &real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **threshold**: Lower limit below which the filter fails
-   **distance_threshold**: Count neighbors for residues closer than this distance
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
