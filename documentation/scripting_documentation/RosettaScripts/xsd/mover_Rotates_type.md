Perform a course random rotation  throughout all rotational degrees of freedom.

```xml
<Rotates name="(&string;)" distribution="(&distribution_string;)"
        degrees="(&non_negative_integer;)" cycles="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        chain="(&string;)" chains="(&string;)" />
```

-   **distribution**: (REQUIRED) Sampling distribution; Either "uniform" or "gaussian"
-   **degrees**: (REQUIRED) How degrees should be rotated around. Recommended=360
-   **cycles**: (REQUIRED) Number of cycles. Recommended: 1000
-   **chain**: Chain to be rotated. Not compatible with "chains" option.
-   **chains**: Comma-separated list of chain IDs. Not compatible with "chain" option.
