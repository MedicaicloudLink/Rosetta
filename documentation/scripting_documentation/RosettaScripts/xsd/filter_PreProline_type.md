Helical space (ABEGO type A) is strongly disfavored before a proline, and Rosetta energy may not capture this effect. In the default mode, the filter simply checks the ABEGO of all residues before prolines and counts the residues that have non-B, non-E abego types (lower = better). With the "use_statistical_potential" option, the filter uses a bicubic spline fit to the data attached to guess at the favorability of a preproline residue with the given phi/psi angles -- this favorability is then returned as the filter score (lower = better).

```xml
<PreProline name="(&string;)" threshold="(&real;)"
        use_statistical_potential="(&bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: Returns true if the value of the spline function is less than or equal to the threshold
-   **use_statistical_potential**: If true, the bicublic spline fit to the statistical potential of Ramachandran space will be used to evaluate the torsions. If false, residues in potentially bad torsion bins will be counted. (default = false)
-   **residue_selector**: The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
