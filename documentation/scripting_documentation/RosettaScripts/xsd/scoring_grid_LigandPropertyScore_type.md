---
A scoring grid that computes a score simply based on a static property of the ligand's chemical composition. Not exactly a grid -- but still capable of delivering a bonus or a penalty for a given ResidueType and fits smoothly within the scoring grid machinery

```xml
<LigandPropertyScore name="(&string;)" parameter="(&string;)" weight="(&real;)" />
```

-   **parameter**: (REQUIRED) The numeric property that the ResidueType of the incoming Residue holds that the LigandPropertyScore is going to query for
-   **weight**: (REQUIRED) XRW TO DO
