XRW TO DO

```xml
<Torsion name="(&string;)" lower="(0 &real;)" upper="(0 &real;)"
        torsion="(&string;)" resnum="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **lower**: Lower torsion threshold
-   **upper**: Upper torsion threshold
-   **torsion**: (REQUIRED) The torsion of interest
-   **resnum**: (REQUIRED) The residue number of interest
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
