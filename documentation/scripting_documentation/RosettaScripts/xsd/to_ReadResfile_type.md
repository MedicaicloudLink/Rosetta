Read a resfile.

```xml
<ReadResfile name="(&string;)" filename="(&string;)" selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **filename**: If a filename is given, read from that file. Otherwise, read the file specified on the commandline with -packing:resfile.
-   **selector**: Optionally, a previously-defined ResidueSelector may be specified using the selector=(some string) option. If this is used, then the ResidueSelector is used as a mask, and the ReadResfile TaskOperation is applied only to those residues selected by the ResidueSelector, even if the resfile lists other residues as well.
