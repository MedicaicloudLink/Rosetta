_Autogenerated Tag Syntax Documentation:_

---
Dumps a pdb. Recommended ONLY for debugging as you can't change the name of the file during a run, although if tag_time is true a timestamp with second resolution will be added to the filename, allowing for a limited amount of multi-dumping. If scorefxn is specified, a scored pdb will be dumped.

```xml
<DumpPdb name="(&string;)" fname="(dump.pdb &string;)" tag_time="(false &bool;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **fname**: Filename of dumped PDB.
-   **tag_time**: If true, adds timestamp to name of pdb file.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
