Replaces current PDB with one from disk. This is probably only useful in checkpointing, since this mover deletes all information gained so far in the trajectory.

```xml
<LoadPDB name="(&string;)" filename="(&string;)" append="(false &bool;)" />

-   **filename**: (REQUIRED) Path to PDB file
-   **append**: Appends the pose conformation to the current pose by a new jump
