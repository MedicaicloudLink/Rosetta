Computes the energy of a particular score type for the entire pose and if that energy is lower than threshold, returns true. If no score_type is set, it filters on the entire scorefxn.

```xml
<ScoreType name="(&string;)" score_type="(total_score &string;)"
        threshold="(&real;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **score_type**: If no score_type is set, it filters on the entire scorefxn.
-   **threshold**: (REQUIRED) If that energy is lower than threshold, returns true.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
