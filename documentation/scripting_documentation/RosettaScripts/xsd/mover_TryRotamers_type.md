XRW TO DO

```xml
<TryRotamers name="(&string;)" pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)" automatic_connection="(1 &bool;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" jump_num="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        solo_res="(1 &bool;)" final_filter="(true_filter &string;)"
        clash_check="(0 &bool;)" include_current="(1 &bool;)"
        explosion="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        shove="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number_cslist;)" />
```

-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **automatic_connection**: Automatically set up a hotspot foldtree
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **jump_num**: Jump across which to evaluate energies, numbered sequentially from one
-   **solo_res**: Add terminal types (upper and lower) to the hotspot residue
-   **final_filter**: Add terminal types (upper and lower) to the hotspot residue
-   **clash_check**: Perform a clash check and filter out clashing rotamers (helps with speed!)
-   **include_current**: Include input conformation
-   **explosion**: Aggression with which to sample conformations, 0-4 (values more than four are equivalent thereto)
-   **shove**: List of residues for which to use the shove type, given in refpose, pose, or PDB numbering
