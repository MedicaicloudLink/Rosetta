Does a file exist on disk? Useful to see whether we're recovering from a checkpoint

```xml
<FileExist name="(&string;)" filename="(&string;)"
        ignore_zero_byte="(false &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **filename**: (REQUIRED) what filename to test?
-   **ignore_zero_byte**: if true, files that are merely place holders (contain nothing) are treated as nonexistant (filter returns false).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
