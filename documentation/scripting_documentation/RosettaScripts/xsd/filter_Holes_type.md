Calculates holes value(?) and filters based upon topology

```xml
<Holes name="(&string;)" cmd="(XRW TO DO &string;)" threshold="(2.0 &real;)"
        exclude_bb_atoms="(false &bool;)" normalize_per_residue="(false &bool;)"
        normalize_per_atom="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **cmd**: expects you to use -holes::dalphaball
-   **threshold**: Threshold value for the filter
-   **exclude_bb_atoms**: don't include backbone (bb) atoms in residue selection (residue_selector case)
-   **normalize_per_residue**: for residue selector case, nomralize per residue
-   **normalize_per_atom**: for residue selector case, normalize per atom; defaults to true if residue_selector if normalize_per_atom and normalize_per_residue not explicitly defined by user
-   **residue_selector**: only calculate holes score for residues in residue_selector; The holes calculation is performed on the Pose as whole (ignoring the ResidueSelector), but the score that's reported is the sum of only the atoms in the residue selector.  The Holes score is a sum of individual atoms/residues anyway (technically PoseBalls), so by only reporting a specific selection, get location-specific data.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
