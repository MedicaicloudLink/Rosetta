Compute the boltzmann-weighted sum of positive and negative filter values.

```xml
<Boltzmann name="(&string;)" fitness_threshold="(0 &real;)"
        temperature="(0.6 &real;)" triage_threshold="(-9999 &real;)"
        norm_neg="(false &bool;)" positive_filter_names="(&string;)"
        negative_filter_names="(&string;)" anchors="(&real_cslist;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **fitness_threshold**: Threshold below which fitness must fall
-   **temperature**: Boltzmann temperature for simulation (kT)
-   **triage_threshold**: Above this value (e.g. delta score/delta ddg), a negative state will be counted in the Boltzmann fitness calculation. This prevents the dilution of negative states
-   **norm_neg**: normalize the fitness of the mutation state in relative to the original state. When triage_threshold is used the number of negative states is changed, therefore norm_neg is needed in order to compare mutations in the same position.
-   **positive_filter_names**: Names of positive filters
-   **negative_filter_names**: Names of negative filters
-   **anchors**: Threshold energy values above which positive states really hurt
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
