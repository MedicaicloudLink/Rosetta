This task operation will turn on the MultiCoolAnnealer when invoking pack_rotamers; the MultiCoolAnnealer produces much lower energies than the regular annealer by spending more time at lower temperatures, and by quenching from many different low-energy rotamer assignments that it encounters during an initial cooling trajectory. See Leaver-Fay, Jacak, Stranges and Kuhlman, PLoS One 2011

```xml
<EnableMultiCoolAnnealer name="(&string;)"
        history_size="(&non_negative_integer;)" />
```

-   **history_size**: The number of low-energy states that the MultiCoolAnnealer will keep from its initial cooling trajectory that will be explored at very low temperature during the final optimization phase. Default of 10.
