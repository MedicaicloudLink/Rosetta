Counts the number of hydrogen bonds across the interface that defines by the jump number

```xml
<InterfaceHbonds name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        threshold="(0 &integer;)" hbond_energy="(0.0 &real;)"
        jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" salt_bridge_mode="(false &bool;)"
        salt_bridge_distance="(4.0 &real;)"
        include_His_chain_terminus="(false &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Which score function to use to find the hydrogen bonds?
-   **threshold**: How many hydrogen bonds should there be across the interface?
-   **hbond_energy**: score cut of the hbond energy to ignore bad hydrogen bonds
-   **jump**: jump number that defines the interface
-   **salt_bridge_mode**: Only count the number of salt bridges?
-   **salt_bridge_distance**: cutoff distance for salt bridges
-   **include_His_chain_terminus**: treat histidine and chain terminus as charge residues?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
