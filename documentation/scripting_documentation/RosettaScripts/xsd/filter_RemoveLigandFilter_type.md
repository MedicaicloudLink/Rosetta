Check if the ligand's pocket is stable by removing the ligand, relaxing the structure and calculating rms to the starting structure.

```xml
<RemoveLigandFilter name="(&string;)" threshold="(3.0 &real;)"
        mover="(&string;)" filter="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: XSD XRW: TO DO score threshold
-   **mover**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **filter**: XSD XRW: TO DO rmsd type filter
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
