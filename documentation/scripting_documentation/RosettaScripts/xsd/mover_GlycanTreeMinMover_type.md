 A class that selects the downstream branch from residues in a movemap/selector, and minimizes those residues if on in the primary glycan movemap. Multiple Applies randomly select a different residue in the movemap/selector

```xml
<GlycanTreeMinMover name="(&string;)" min_rings="(false &bool;)"
        min_bb="(true &bool;)" min_chi="(true &bool;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **min_rings**: Minimize Ring Torsions?
-   **min_bb**: Minimize the Backbone?
-   **min_chi**: Minimize the Chi angles?
-   **residue_selector**: The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object
