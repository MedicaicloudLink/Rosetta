filter based upon the intra repeat contacts

```xml
<IntraRepeatContactsPerResidue name="(&string;)" threshold="(0.0 &real;)"
        numb_repeats="(4 &non_negative_integer;)"
        sequenceSeperation="(6 &non_negative_integer;)"
        distanceThreshold="(10.0 &real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: Filter threshold
-   **numb_repeats**: number of repeats
-   **sequenceSeperation**: seperation in the sequence
-   **distanceThreshold**: max distance between two CA atoms being compared
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
