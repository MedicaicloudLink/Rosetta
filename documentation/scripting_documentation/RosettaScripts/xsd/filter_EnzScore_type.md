filter that calculates the energy based upon either the ligand (speficified with resnum), a set of cstid, or the whole pose; one of these must be specified

```xml
<EnzScore name="(&string;)" cstid="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        score_type="(total_score &string;)" energy_cutoff="(0 &real;)"
        whole_pose="(0 &bool;)" pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **cstid**: Expects cstid string to be of format [0-9]+[A-Z], where the number is constraint number and trailing letter is temlplate id i.e. either A or B
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **score_type**: type of score to be evaluated; default is total_score
-   **energy_cutoff**: filters the energy based upon this cutoff value
-   **whole_pose**: determines whether to evalue the score based upon the whole pose or not
-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
