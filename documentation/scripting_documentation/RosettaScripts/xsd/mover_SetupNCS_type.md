Establishes a non crystallographic symmetry (NCS) between residues. The mover sets dihedral constraints on backbone and side chains to force residues to maintain the same conformation. The amino acid type can be enforced too. This mover does not perform any minimization, so it is usually followed by MinMover or RelaxMover.

```

-   **bb**: Sets dihedral constraints for backbone.
-   **chi**: Sets dihedral constraints for side chains.
-   **wt**: XRW TO DO
-   **limit**: XRW TO DO
-   **symmetric_sequence**: Forces the sequence from the source into the target.
-   **sd**: for Harmonic, distance
-   **distance_pair**: descrip


Subtag **NCSgroup**:   

-   **source**: Reference residues, express as single residue or interval. Source and target need the same number of residues.
-   **target**: Target residues, express as single residue or interval. Source and target need the same number of residues.

Subtag **NCSend**:   

-   **source**: Reference residues, express as single residue or interval. Source and target need the same number of residues.
-   **target**: Target residues, express as single residue or interval. Source and target need the same number of residues.

Subtag **NCSdistance**:   

-   **source**: Reference residues, express as single residue or interval. Source and target need the same number of residues.
-   **target**: Target residues, express as single residue or interval. Source and target need the same number of residues.
