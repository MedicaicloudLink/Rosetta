Computes the dG from dsTbL profiles of every residue in every span, and multiply it by its relative SASA

```xml
<MembAccesResidueLipophilicity name="(&string;)" threshold="(0.0 &real;)"
        verbose="(false &bool;)" ignore_burial="(false &bool;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: if score lower than threshold, pass
-   **verbose**: whehter to print a table of dG and SASA
-   **ignore_burial**: disregard the SASA in the calculation
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
