This mover runs Monte Carlo (MC) simulation in isothermal-isobaric (NPT) condition on a periodic boundary box. Can be applied to a broad range of (small molecules) to extract their thermodynamic properties. Currently it has been applied to running liquid-state simulation of small molecules; see Park et al (2016), "Simultaneous optimization of biomolecular energy function on features from small molecules and macromolecules", JCTC. Details will be added more in near future.

```

-   **scorefxn**: weights file for the simulation
-   **nmol_side**: number of molecules per each dimension; total molecules = nmol_side^3
-   **initial_density**: initial density of small molecules in g/cm^3. initial guess is 1.0 from water, but in general other small molecules have lower densities
-   **temp**: temperature in Kelvin
-   **vol_step**: maximum magnitude of the rotational movement
-   **trans_step**: XRW TO DO
-   **rot_step**: maximum magnitude of the rotational movement
-   **tor_step**: maximum magnitude of the torsion movement. Will try to rotate the torsions given in the residue file
-   **probability_rigid**: XRW TO DO
-   **resize_vol_every**: how often volume movement is called during MC. Otherwise will randomly call either rotation or torsion movement
-   **report_every**: how often will dump the energy components to score file
-   **report_silent**: XRW TO DO
-   **report_scorefile**: name of the file to report energy components along the trajectory
-   **dump_every**: dump_every - how often will dump the silent file (if requested)
-   **nsteps_equilibrate**: Number of MC steps for equilibration
-   **nsteps_sim**: Number of MC steps for production simulation
-   **istart**: simulation step to begin with; used for continuing simulation
-   **central_molecule_pdb**: XRW TO DO
-   **correct_LJtruncation**: whether to add the correction coming from long-range LJ interaction (by integrating over the distance from fa_max_dis to infinity); should be turned on for liquid simulation
-   **report_thermodynamics**: how often will report thermodynamic properties -- currently not very useful
-   **pressure**: Pressure in atm
-   **rg_atom1**: XRW TO DO
-   **rg_atom2**: XRW TO DO
