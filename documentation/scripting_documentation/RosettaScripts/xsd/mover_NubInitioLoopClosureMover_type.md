Applies CCD closure to a NubInitioMover result, being aware of its restrictions through labels.

```xml
<NubInitioLoopClosureMover name="(&string;)" max_trials="(10 &integer;)"
        fragments_id="(&string;)" break_side="(3 &integer;)"
        break_side_ramp="(0 &bool;)" trust="(0 &bool;)" label="(1 &bool;)"
        design="(0 &bool;)" centroid_scorefxn="(&string;)"
        fullatom_scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **max_trials**: Defines how many times we should try to close the breakpoints before giving up.
-   **fragments_id**: (REQUIRED) Fragments are necessary to close the loop. They need to be included/created with StructFragmentMover. The value set in the 'prefix' attribute of that Mover needs to be provided here again.
-   **break_side**: Defines number of sequence neighbors around breakpoint residues (multisegment motif) allowed to minimize in order to achieve the chain break closure.
-   **break_side_ramp**: In each breakpoint closure trial, increase by one the number of side residues allowed to move.
-   **trust**: Do nothing on those cutpoints that seem to have been closed before reaching this Mover.
-   **label**: If set to true (default), labels residues changed by loop_closure to LOOPCLOSURE and repacked residues as REPACKED.
-   **design**: If set to true (not default), redesigns residues of the closed loops and around as longs as they are labeled as TEMPLATE or COLDSPOT.
-   **centroid_scorefxn**: Centroid Score function to use.
-   **fullatom_scorefxn**: Centroid Score function to use.
