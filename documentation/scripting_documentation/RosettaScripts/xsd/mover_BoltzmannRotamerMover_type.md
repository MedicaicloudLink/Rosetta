Part of CoupledMoves. Replaces a single rotamer based on the Boltzmann probabilities of its rotamers

```xml
<BoltzmannRotamerMover name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        show_packer_task="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **show_packer_task**: show the PackerTask to be used at the beginning of apply
