Checks for clashes between docking residues and DNA backbone

```xml
<DNAClashCheck name="(&string;)" fa_rep_thresh="(50.0 &real;)"
        dna_a_path="(&string;)" dna_b_path="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **fa_rep_thresh**: Threshold fa_rep clash score.
-   **dna_a_path**: File path to DNA A chain
-   **dna_b_path**: File path to DNa B chain
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
