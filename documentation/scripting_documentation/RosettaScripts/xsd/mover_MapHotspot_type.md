Map out the residues that might serve as a hotspot region on a target. This requires massive user guidance. Each hot-spot residue should be roughly placed by the user (at least as backbone) against the target. Each hot-spot residue should have a different chain ID. The method iterates over all allowed residue identities and all allowed rotamers for each residue. Tests its filters and for the subset that pass selects the lowest-energy residue by score12. Once the first hot-spot residue is identified it iterates over the next and so on until all hot-spot residues are placed. The output contains one file per residue identity combination.

```xml

```

-   **clash_check**: Perform a clash check
