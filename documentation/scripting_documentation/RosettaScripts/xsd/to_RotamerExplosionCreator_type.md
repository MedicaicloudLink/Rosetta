Sample residue chi angles much more finely during packing. Currently hardcoded to use three 1/3 step standard deviation.

```xml
<RotamerExplosionCreator name="(&string;)" resnum="(&positive_integer;)"
        chi="(&non_negative_integer;)" />
```

-   **resnum**: (REQUIRED) Residue number.
-   **chi**: (REQUIRED) Chi level 0-3?
