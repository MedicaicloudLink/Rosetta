Align a chain in the working pose to a chain in a pose on disk (CA superposition). All chains in the moving pose are rotated into the new coordinate frame, but the rotation is calculated on the specified chain. Specifying the 0th chain results in a whole-Pose alignment. target and source chains must have the same length of residues.

```xml
<AlignChain name="(&string;)" target_name="(&string;)"
        source_chain="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        target_chain="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" align_to_com="(0 &bool;)" />
```

-   **target_name**: (REQUIRED) file name of the target pose on disk. The pose will be read just once at the start of the run and saved in memory to save I/O
-   **source_chain**: the chain number in the working pose. 0 means the entire pose
-   **target_chain**: the chain number in the target pose. 0 means the entire pose
-   **align_to_com**: If true, will align pose to COM instead of target
