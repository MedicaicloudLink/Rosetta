A metric to report the total energy of the system or the delta total energy between another input pose or the cmd-line set native.

```xml
<TotalEnergyMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        reference_name="(&string;)" use_native="(false &bool;)"
        scoretype="(total_score &scoretypes;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use (Use the SavePoseMover to create a reference pose)
-   **use_native**: Use the native as reference for DELTA score if present on the cmd-line.
-   **scoretype**: ScoreType to calculate.
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we calculate the total energy of only these residues.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
