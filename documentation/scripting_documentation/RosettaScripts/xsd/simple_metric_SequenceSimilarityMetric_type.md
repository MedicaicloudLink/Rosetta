A metric for measuring sequence similarity between the trajectry pose and the native pose. Sums the score of each selected position using BLOSUM62 (note that the score of an unmutated pose is almost certainly not 0). Must use the -native flag for this to work correctly.

```xml
<SequenceSimilarityMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        apply_selector_to_native="(false &bool;)" normalize="(true &bool;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **apply_selector_to_native**: If true, apply the residue selector to the native pose instead of the given pose.
-   **normalize**: Divide the final score by the number of positions
-   **residue_selector**: Choose which residues are to be counted.
