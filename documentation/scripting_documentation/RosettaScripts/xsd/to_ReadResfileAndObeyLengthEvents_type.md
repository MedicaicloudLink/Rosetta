Read resfile and obey length events. IMPORTANT: only use this if any length changes are not reflected in the pose's pdb info, such as seems to be the case after vlb not quite certain on the ideal approach yet. it's prolly best to parse the resfile, and then apply the ResfileCommands to the remapped residues. this necessitates getting the ResfileContents. the code under 2. here is some duplication of ResfileReader::parse_resfile/parse_resfile_string, ideally this and ResfileReader should be refactored a bit.

```xml
<ReadResfileAndObeyLengthEvents name="(&string;)" filename="(&string;)"
        selector="(&string;)" default_commands_for_inserts="(1 &bool;)" />
```

-   **filename**: If a filename is given, read from that file. Otherwise, read the file specified on the commandline with -packing:resfile.
-   **selector**: Optionally, a previously-defined ResidueSelector may be specified using the selector=(some string) option. If this is used, then the ResidueSelector is used as a mask, and the ReadResfile TaskOperation is applied only to those residues selected by the ResidueSelector, even if the resfile lists other residues as well.
-   **default_commands_for_inserts**: apply the ResfileCommands to the remapped seqpos.
