The IMPORT statement is meant to be used in conjuction with the MultiplePoseMover. It allows users who have defined Movers, Filters, and TaskOperations at a higher level of the protocol to avoid having to redefine them in order to use them within the MultiplePoseMover. The classes that are imported will be re-parsed within the inner context. This parsing occurs before any of sub-elements of the ROSETTASCRIPTS block are loaded, reguardless of the order in which the IMPORT statement appears. Multiple IMPORT statements may be needed, e.g. if certain TaskOperations must be loaded before other Movers which require those TaskOperations are parsed.

```xml
<IMPORT taskoperations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        movers="(&string;)" filters="(&string;)" />
```

-   **taskoperations**: A comma separated list of TaskOperations that have been defined at a higher level than the MultiplePoseMover that this IMPORT statement is inside of
-   **movers**: A comma separated list of Movers that have been defined at a higher level than the MultiplePoseMover that this IMPORT statement is inside of
-   **filters**: A comma separated list of Filters that have been defined at a higher level than the MultiplePoseMover that this IMPORT statement is inside of
