The inverse of SetupForSymmetry: given a symmetric pose, make a nonsymmetric pose that contains only the asymmetric unit.

```xml
<ExtractAsymmetricUnit name="(&string;)" keep_virtual="(&bool;)"
        keep_unknown_aas="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **keep_virtual**: If true, virtual atoms will be left in the pose. If false, the extracted asymmetric unit will not contain virtual atoms.
-   **keep_unknown_aas**: If true, amino acids in the input symmetric pose with aa type aa_unk will be included in the asymmetric unit. If false, amino acids with type aa_unk will be ignored and will not be included in the resulting asymmetric unit.
