Allows modification of the temperatures and quench used by the annealer during packing.

```xml
<ModifyAnnealer name="(&string;)" disallow_quench="(false &bool;)"
        high_temp="(100.0 &real;)" low_temp="(0.3 &real;)" />
```

-   **disallow_quench**: quench accepts every change that lowers the energy. If you want more diversity it could be prudent to disallow the quench step. Quench is on by default.
-   **high_temp**: the starting high temperature for the annealer
-   **low_temp**: the temperature that the annealer cools to
