The ConnectJumps, as the Doxygen calls it, is deprecated. Use BridgeChains instead.

-   **chain1**: Indicates the chain which is to be located at the N-terminal end of the new fragment. Building will begin at the C-terminal residue of the jump.
-   **chain2**: Indicates the chain which is to be located at the C-terminal end of the new fragment.
-   **segment1**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **segment2**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **motif**: The secondary structure + abego to be used for the backbone region to be rebuilt. Taken from input pose if not specified. The format of this string is: "[Length][SS][ABEGO]-[Length2][SS2][ABEGO2]-...-[LengthN][SSN][ABEGON]" For example, "1LX-5HA-1LB-1LA-1LB-6EB" will build a one residue loop of any abego, followed by a 5-residue helix, followed by a 3-residue loop of ABEGO BAB, followed by a 6-residue strand.
-   **cutpoint**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **ideal_abego**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **extend_ss**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **overlap**: Build overlap of nested BuildDeNovoBackboneMover
-   **dry_run**: Sets folder of BuildDeNovoBackboneMover to RandomTorsionPoseFolder instead of RemodelLoopMoverPoseFolde
-   **trials**: iterations per phase of nested BuildDeNovoBackboneMover
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
