scaling factor for the interaction energy of the residue pairs across the interface.

```xml
<ProteinProteinInterfaceUpweighter name="(&string;)"
        interface_weight="(1.0 &real;)" skip_loop_in_chain="(&string;)" />
```

-   **interface_weight**: scaling factor for the interaction energy of the residue pairs across the interface
-   **skip_loop_in_chain**: comma seperated chain idenfitiers for chains that the weight related to its loops are retained to 1.0
