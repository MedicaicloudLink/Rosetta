Calculates an interface rmsd. Rmsd is calculated over all backbone atoms for those residues found in the interface of the reference structure. Interface residues are those residues which are within 8 Angstroms of any residue on the other side of the interface.

```xml
<IRmsd name="(&string;)" reference_name="(&string;)" threshold="(5 &real;)"
        jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use (Use the SavePoseMover to create a reference pose)
-   **threshold**: RMSD threshold above which we would fail the filter
-   **jump**: Jump for calculating docking RMSD, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
