This carbohydrate-specific Mover randomly selects a free reducing end (not a glycoside) and inverts the stereochemistry, swapping alpha anomers for beta and beta for alpha.  (This could be considered an extremely limited design case; however, reducing ends readily tautomerize in solution, in contrast to other cases, in which residues do not readily mutate into others!)  It is generally not certain which form is preferred (if any) in sugar-binding proteins, and crystal structures sometimes arbitrarily assign one anomer over another when fitting density, so this Mover can assure that each anomer is sampled.

```xml
<TautomerizeAnomerMover name="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **residue_selector**: The name of a pre-defined ResidueSelector.
