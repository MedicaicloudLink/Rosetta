Measures the number of chainBreaks in the pose

```xml
<ChainBreak name="(&string;)" threshold="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        chain_num="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" tolerance="(0.13 &real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: Number of chainbreaks allowed
-   **chain_num**: which chain should we check for
-   **tolerance**: the allowed angstrom deviation from the mean optimal bond length
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
