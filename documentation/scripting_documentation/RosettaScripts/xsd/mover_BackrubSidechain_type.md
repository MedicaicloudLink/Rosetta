Backrub for off-rotamer sidechains

```xml
<BackrubSidechain name="(&string;)" pivot_residues="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        task_factory="(&string;)" packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)"
        prob_uniform="(0.0 &real;)" prob_withinrot="(0.0 &real;)"
        prob_random_pert_current="(0.0 &real;)"

        statistics_fileame="(brsc_stats.txt &string;)" />
```

-   **pivot_residues**: residues for which contiguous stretches can contain segments (comma separated) can use PDB numbers ([resnum][chain]) or absolute Rosetta numbers (integer)
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **task_factory**: A TaskFactory specification to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **prob_uniform**: probability of a uniform move - all sidechain chis are uniformly randomized between -180 degrees and 180 degrees
-   **prob_withinrot**: within rotamer - sidechain chis are picked from the Dunbrack distribution for the current rotamer
-   **prob_random_pert_current**: random perturbation of current position - the current sidechain chis are perturbed +/- 10 degrees from their current positions, biased by the resulting Dunbrack energy. Note that if your score function contains a Dunbrack energy term, this will result in double counting issues.
-   **preserve_detailed_balance**: if set to true, does not change branching atom angles during apply and sets ideal branch angles during initialization if used with MetropolisHastings
-   **require_mm_bend**: if true and used with MetropolisHastings, will exit if mm_bend is not in the score function
-   **record_statistics**: Write histogram of MC scores to statistics_file
-   **statistics_fileame**: Name of file where statistics are being dumped into
