Co-opt the PDB field for temperature factors to instead store filter values

```xml
<SetTemperatureFactor name="(&string;)" filter="(&string;)"
        scaling="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **filter**: Filter to apply
-   **scaling**: Scale filter value by this amount prior to storing in temperature factor
