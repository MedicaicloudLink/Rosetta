Run mean-field on pose

```xml
<GenMeanFieldMover name="(&string;)" lambda_memory="(0.5 &real;)"
        tolerance="(0.0001 &real;)" temperature="(0.8 &real;)"
        init_option="(1 &real;)" threshold="(10 &real;)" unbound="(0 &bool;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" />
```

-   **lambda_memory**: Used in updating the original mean-field matrix to decrease oscillation.
-   **tolerance**: Tolerance used to determine if convergence is achieved.
-   **temperature**: kT used in Boltzmann weighting.
-   **init_option**: Determines initial values of mean-field matrix. A value of 1 forces initial values of 1/nrot and a value of 0 forces initial values of 0.  This has not been tested with a value of 0.
-   **threshold**: Threshold for truncation of energy matrix values.
-   **unbound**: Unbind protein from substrate before running?
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
