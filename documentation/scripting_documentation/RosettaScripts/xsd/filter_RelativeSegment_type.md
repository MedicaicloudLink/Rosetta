Reports the numbers of residues that align with a segment on source pose.

```xml
<RelativeSegment name="(&string;)" source_pose="(&string;)"
        start_res="(&non_negative_integer;)" end_res="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **source_pose**: (REQUIRED) PDB file storing the pose to which to align. The two poses should be superimposed prior to running. This filter will not superimpose.
-   **start_res**: (REQUIRED) Starting residue for alignment. Rosetta numbering only
-   **end_res**: (REQUIRED) Ending residue for alignment. Rosetta numbering only
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
