Intended to perform anything one would want to do in a DNA interface that uses a single incarnation of the RotamerSets/InteractionGraph combo. For basic packing/designing, the more basic PackRotamersMover can be used instead, provided it receives the appropriate TaskFactory/TaskOperations. This derived class, however, takes advantage of the reusability of packer data to accomplish some higher-level functions, such as rapid estimations of multi-state specificity, reversions, and mutational scanning.

```xml
<DnaInterfacePacker name="(&string;)" binding="(&bool;)" base_only="(&bool;)"
        minimize="(&bool;)" reversion_scan="(&bool;)"
        probe_specificity="(&non_negative_integer;)" pdb_output="(&bool;)"
        protein_scan="(&bool;)" allowed_types="(&bool;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" />
```

-   **binding**: calculate binding energy
-   **base_only**: consider only interaction with the DNA bases
-   **minimize**: minimize protein side chains at the interface
-   **reversion_scan**: revert mutations that do not contribute to the specificity score
-   **probe_specificity**: calculate binding energy of designed protein for alternative DNA targets and calculate a specificity score
-   **pdb_output**: write out unbound pose to verify proper interface separation
-   **protein_scan**: brief runs a single-residue scan of user-defined amino acid possibilities to estimate affinity and specificity of single mutants w/ respect to relevant DNA
-   **allowed_types**: allowed residue types for design. default: ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY;
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
