        loop_start="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        loop_end="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)" delta="(&integer;)"
        restype="(&canonical_res_char;)" />
```

-   **loop_start**: (REQUIRED) Starting residue number for loop, formatted in seqpos or PDB or refpose numbering
-   **loop_end**: (REQUIRED) Ending residue number for loop, formatted in seqpos or PDB or refpose numbering
-   **delta**: (REQUIRED) Number of residues to extend or contract the loop
