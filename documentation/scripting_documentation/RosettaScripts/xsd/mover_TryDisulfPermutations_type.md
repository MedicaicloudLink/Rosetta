Mover that tries different sets of possible disulfide bonds between existing residues capable of forming disulfides

```xml
<TryDisulfPermutations name="(&string;)" consider_already_bonded="(&bool;)"
        min_type="(&minimizer_type;)" min_tolerance="(&real;)"
        selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **consider_already_bonded**: Also sample permutations of disulfides that are already bonded
-   **min_type**: Type of minimization to perform
-   **min_tolerance**: tolerance for the minimizer
-   **selector**: Residue selector specifying which residues to consider
