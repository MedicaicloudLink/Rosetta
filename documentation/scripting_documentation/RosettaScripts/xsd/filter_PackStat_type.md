Calculates packing statistics

```xml
<PackStat name="(&string;)" threshold="(0.58 &real;)"
        chain="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" repeats="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **threshold**: packstat above which filter passes. Common wisdom says 0.65 is a good number.
-   **chain**: jump on which to separate the complex before computing packstat. 0 means not to separate the complex.
-   **repeats**: How many times to repeat the calculation.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
