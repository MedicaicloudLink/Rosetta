Compare a set of homologous but structurally heterogeneous PDBs to a template PDB and find structurally highly conserved sites that can serve as stems for splicing segments

```xml
<StemFinder name="(&string;)" rmsd="(0.7 &real;)" stems_on_sse="(false &bool;)"
        stems_are_neighbors="(true &bool;)" neighbor_distance="(4.0 &real;)"
        neighbor_seperation="(10 &non_negative_integer;)" filenames="(&string;)"
        from_res="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        to_res="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **rmsd**: cutoff for the average rmsd between a given position in the template and all of the closest positions in the homologs.
-   **stems_on_sse**: demand that in each of the homologs the candidate stems are on 2ary structural elements
-   **stems_are_neighbors**: should we eliminate stems that are farther than neighbor_distance from one another?
-   **neighbor_distance**: minimal atomic distance between any pair of atoms on each of the residues
-   **neighbor_seperation**: minimal aa separation between candidate stem sites
-   **filenames**: (REQUIRED) PDB structures that are well aligned to the template
-   **from_res**: starting template position in which to search for stems
-   **to_res**: ending template position in which to search for stems
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
