PredesignPerturbMover randomly perturbs a ligand in a protein active site. The input protein will be transformed to a polyalanine context for residues surrounding the ligand. A number of random rotation+translation moves are made and then accepted/rejected based on the Boltzmann criteria with a modified (no attractive) score function (enzdes_polyA_min.wts).

```xml
<PredesignPerturbMover name="(&string;)" trans_magnitude="(0.1 &real;)"
        rot_magnitude="(2.0 &real;)" dock_trials="(100 &non_negative_integer;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        task_factory="(&string;)" packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" />
```

-   **trans_magnitude**: how large (stdev of a gaussian) a random translation step to take in each of x, y, and z (angstrom)
-   **rot_magnitude**: how large (stdev of a gaussian) a random rotational step to take in each of the Euler angles (degrees)
-   **dock_trials**: the number of Monte Carlo steps to attempt
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **task_factory**: A TaskFactory specification to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
