The RandomizeBBByRamaPrePro mover randomizes a backbone, or selected residues in a backbone, biased by the Ramachandran preferences of each amino acid, using the RamaPrePro energy term (which uses different scoring tables for positions before proline/peptoids than it does for other positions).

```xml
<RandomizeBBByRamaPrePro name="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **residue_selector**: An optional residue selector.  If provided, the mover will only randomize the subset of residues that are selected.  If not provided, then the mover is applied to the whole pose.
