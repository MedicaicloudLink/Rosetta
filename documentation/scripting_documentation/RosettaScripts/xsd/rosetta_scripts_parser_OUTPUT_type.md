The OUTPUT element controls the final score function that is used by RosettaScripts before outputting a Pose. If for example you have been using a score function with constraints in your protocol, but at the end, want to output the unconstrained scores, then you can set the score function in the OUTPUT element to some ScoreFunction that has constraint weights of zero and then RosettaScripts will rescore the Pose with that ScoreFunction right before writing the scores to disk.

```xml
<OUTPUT scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
