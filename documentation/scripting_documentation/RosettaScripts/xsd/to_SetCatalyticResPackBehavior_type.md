Ensures that catalytic residues as specified in a match/constraint file do not get designed. If no option is specified the constrained residues will be set to repack only (not design).

```xml
<SetCatalyticResPackBehavior name="(&string;)" fix_catalytic_aa="(true &bool;)"
        behavior_non_catalytic="(&string;)" />
```

-   **fix_catalytic_aa**: If set to 1, the catalytic residues will be set to fixed (non-repacking).  Otherwise they will be set to repack only (not design).
-   **behavior_non_catalytic**: Pass a resfile-style command to apply to non-catalytic residues.  For example, NATRO, PIKAA, etc.
