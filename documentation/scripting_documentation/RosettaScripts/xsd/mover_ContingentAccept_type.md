checks filter, runs mover, checks filter.  Resets pose if filter value increases by more than delta. NOT Monte Carlo.

```xml
<ContingentAccept name="(&string;)" filter="(&string;)" mover="(&string;)"
        delta="(5.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **filter**: (REQUIRED) Filter whose value is compared before and after applying the Mover; looked up from DataMap.
-   **mover**: (REQUIRED) Mover whose move is contingently accepted.
-   **delta**: Amount Filter value can increase before rejection (units depend on Filter)
