Idealize a pose, moving its bond lengths and angles towards ideal values by repeated relaxation

```xml
<RNAIdealizeMover name="(&string;)" iterations="(&positive_integer;)"
        noise="(&bool;)" final_minimize="(&bool;)"
        ang_significance_threshold="(&real;)" />
```

-   **iterations**: Number of iterations over which to spread idealization
-   **noise**: Salt initial pose with some Gaussian noise
-   **final_minimize**: Minimize the whole pose at once at the end
-   **ang_significance_threshold**: Size of angle deviation to correct (degrees)
