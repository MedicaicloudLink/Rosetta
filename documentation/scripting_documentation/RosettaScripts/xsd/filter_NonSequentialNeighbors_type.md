Filters based upon the number of neighboring residues in a non-sequential fashion.

```xml
<NonSequentialNeighbors name="(&string;)" distance_threshold="(8.0 &real;)"
        neighbor_cutoff="(10 &non_negative_integer;)" bound="(false &bool;)"
        resnum="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **distance_threshold**: distance from given residue from which to count the number of neighbors
-   **neighbor_cutoff**: number of neighboring residues that defines the cutoff
-   **bound**: is the protein bound or not?
-   **resnum**: The number indicating the residue of interest. If set to 0, the entire protein will be anlayzed.
-   **jump**: jump number
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
