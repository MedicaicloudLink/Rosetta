This mover takes a non-symmetric pose composed of symmetric chains and transforms it into a symmetric system. It only works with cyclic symmetries from C2 to C99.

```xml
<DetectSymmetry name="(&string;)" subunit_tolerance="(0.01 &real;)"
        plane_tolerance="(1e-3 &real;)" ignore_single_jump="(false &bool;)"
        keep_pdb_info_labels="(false &bool;)" keep_pdb_remarks="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **subunit_tolerance**: Maximum tolerated CA-rmsd between the chains.
-   **plane_tolerance**: Maximum accepted displacement(angstroms) of the center of mass of the whole pose from the xy-plane.
-   **ignore_single_jump**: whether to ignore a single jump when caculating the symmetry
-   **keep_pdb_info_labels**: keep PDB-InfoLabel tags in new symmetric Pose object
-   **keep_pdb_remarks**: keep PDB file remarks in new symmetric Pose object
