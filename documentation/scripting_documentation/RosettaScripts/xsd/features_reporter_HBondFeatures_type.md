Record features related to all the hydrogen bonds made in a Pose

```xml
<HBondFeatures name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        definition_type="(energy &hbond_def;)" definition_threshold="(0 &real;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Scorefunction
-   **definition_type**: Definition for hydrogen bond assignment: either by 'energy' or acceptor-H distance ('AHdist')
-   **definition_threshold**: Threshold for making an H-bond assignment. Probably should be -1 - 0 for energy, 2-2.8 for AHdist
