The ResidueSpanSelector sets the positions corresponding to the residues between the start and end points to true, and all other positions to false. Note that it does not support PDB insertion codes.

```xml
<Span name="(&string;)" start="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        end="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)" />
```

-   **start**: The starting residue of the span.
-   **end**: The ending residue of the span.
