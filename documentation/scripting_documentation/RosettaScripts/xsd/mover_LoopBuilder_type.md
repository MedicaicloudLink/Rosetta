Builds in backbone atoms for loop regions where they are missing. The backbones created by LoopBuilder will have ideal bond lengths, ideal bond angles, and torsions picked from a Ramachandran distribution.

```xml
<LoopBuilder name="(&string;)" loops_file="(&string;)"
        max_attempts="(&non_negative_integer;)" />
```

-   **loops_file**: path to loops file
-   **max_attempts**: Stop after n cycles irrespective of convergence.
