-   **start_temperature**: Temperature at start of simulated annealing
-   **end_temperature**: Temperature at end of simulated annealing
-   **add_probability**: Probability of adding a triplet of segments at any given step during assembly
-   **delete_probability**: Probability of deleting a terminal triplet of segments at any given step during assembly
-   **conformer_switch_probability**: Probability of switching ligand conformers during assembly. This should only be used if a ligand is present AND if you have provided conformers for that ligand.
-   **window_width**: Required number of overlapping residues for two segments to be considered a match. Used in hashless SEWING only (for hashed SEWING, this is determined by the hasher settings used when generating the edge file).
-   **minimum_cycles**: Minimum number of Monte Carlo cycles for assembly before completion requirements are checked.
-   **maximum_cycles**: Maximum number of Monte Carlo cycles for assembly before forced termination.
-   **model_file_name**: (REQUIRED) Path to file defining segments to use during assembly
-   **hashed**: Use the hasher during assembly to check overlap of all atoms? Requires an input edge file.
-   **edge_file_name**: Path to edge file to use during assembly (only used if hashed is set to true)
-   **max_segments**: Maximum number of segments to include in the final assembly
-   **max_segment_length**: Maximum number of residues to include in a segment
-   **output_pose_per_move**: Setting to true will output a pose after each move/revert.
-   **recover_lowest_assembly**: Setting to true will output the lowest assembly in the final pose
