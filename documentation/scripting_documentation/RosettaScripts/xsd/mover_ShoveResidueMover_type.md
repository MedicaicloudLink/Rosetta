XRW TO DO

```xml
<ShoveResidueMover name="(&string;)" pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)" remove_shove_variant="(false &bool;)"
        shove="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number_cslist;)" />
```

-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **remove_shove_variant**: Remove the shove variant from the residue in question?
-   **shove**: Residues to which to add shove variant, especially if resnum isn't provided
