Movemap builders can build on previousy-defined InterfaceBuilders to define the flexible sidechain and backbone dihedrals by creating a MoveMap.

```xml
<MoveMapBuilder name="(&string;)" sc_interface="(&string;)"
        bb_interface="(&string;)" minimize_water="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **sc_interface**: The name of the previously declared interface builder to use when deciding what sidechains to allow to move when building a MoveMap
-   **bb_interface**: The name of the previously declared interface builder to use when deciding what backbone torsions to allow to move when building a MoveMap
-   **minimize_water**: Should water residues be allowed to move?
