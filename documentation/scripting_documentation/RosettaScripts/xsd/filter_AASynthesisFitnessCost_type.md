Measures the fitness cost of an amino acid sequence

```xml
<AASynthesisFitnessCost name="(&string;)" fitnessCostPerATP="(0.00001 &real;)"
        threshold="(1000 &non_negative_integer;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **fitnessCostPerATP**: Sets the fitness loss cost per metabolic cost (think ATP usage) for synthesis
-   **threshold**: threshold
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
