Selects residues in the pose at random. Note that this residue selector is stochastic. This is, it will return a different set of residues every time it is called. However, the randomly selected residues can be saved using the StoreResidueSubsetMover and retrieved using the StoredResidueSubset selector.

```xml
<RandomResidue name="(&string;)" num_residues="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        select_res_cluster="(&bool;)" distance_cutoff="(&real;)"
        selector="(&string;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</RandomResidue>
```

-   **num_residues**: The number of residues to be randomly selected
-   **select_res_cluster**: option to only select multiple residues near each other, only applies to case where num_residues greater than 1, multiple random residues are required to be within distance_cutoff angstroms of one another
-   **distance_cutoff**: only active when select_res_cluster set to true, distance that defines whether two residues are neighbors or not
-   **selector**: Defines the subset from which random residues are chosen.
