fails if the res_num residue is in the wrong chirality (D / L)

```xml
<ResidueChirality name="(&string;)" residue_type="(L &string;)"
        res_num="(1 &integer;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **residue_type**: the type you want to pass
-   **res_num**: which residue to test
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
