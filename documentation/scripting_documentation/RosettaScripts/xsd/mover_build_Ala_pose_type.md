XRW TO DO

```xml
<build_Ala_pose name="(&string;)" partner1="(0 &bool;)" partner2="(1 &bool;)"
        interface_cutoff_distance="(8.0 &real;)" AA="(ALA &string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" />
```

-   **partner1**: Design/repack the first chain
-   **partner2**: Design/repack the second chain
-   **interface_cutoff_distance**: Distance from the interface that counts for backrubbing
-   **AA**: Amino acid, by name, from which to build the pose
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
