The PhiSelector selects alpha-amino acids that are in either the positive phi or negative phi region of Ramachandran space. Ligands and polymeric residues that are not alpha-amion acids are never selected. Alpha-amino acids with no lower connection (or nothing connected at the lower connection) are also never selected. By default, alpha-amino acids with no upper connection are not selected, though this can be disabled.

```xml
<Phi name="(&string;)" select_positive_phi="(true &bool;)"
        ignore_unconnected_upper="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **select_positive_phi**: If true (the default), alpha-amino acids with phi values greater than or equal to zero are selected. If false, alpha-amino acids with phi values less than zero are selected.
-   **ignore_unconnected_upper**: If true (the default) then C-terminal residues and other residues with nothing connected at the upper connection are not selected. If false, then these residues can be selected, depending on their phi values. Note that anything lacking a lower connection is never selected
