## SpecificResiduesNearInterface

Filter for poses that have a specific set of residues near the interface. For example, this can be useful for designs that depend on say the N-terminus being close to the interface

```xml
<SpecificResiduesNearInterface name="(&string)" task_operation="(&string)"/>
```
