## ModifyAnnealer

Allows modification of the temperatures and quench used by the annealer during packing.

```xml
<ModifyAnnealer name="(&string)" high_temp="(100.0 &Real)" low_temp="(0.3 &Real)" disallow_quench="(0 &bool)"/>
```

-   high\_temp - the starting high temperature for the annealer
-   low\_temp - the temperature that the annealer cools to
-   disallow\_quench - quench accepts every change that lowers the energy. If you want more diversity it could be prudent to disallow the quench step. Quench is on by default.
