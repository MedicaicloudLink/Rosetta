##The Four Steps of Old SEWING

1. [[Model Generation|model-generation]] - Extraction of 'models' from native structures
2. [[Model Comparison|model-comparison-with-geometric-hashing]] - Structurally compare models to one another using a geometric hashing algorithm
3. [[Assembly|assembly-of-models]] - Stitch models together based on structural superimposition to form novel backbones
4. [[Refinement|Refinement of SEWING assemblies]] - Refine backbones, design side chains, and select structures generated using SEWING
