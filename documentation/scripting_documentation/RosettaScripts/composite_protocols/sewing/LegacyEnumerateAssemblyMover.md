The EnumerateAssemblyMover is a mover within the [[SEWING]] framework. This mover exhaustively traverses all possible paths in the SewGraph to create assemblies. Therefore, this mover is useful when there is not enough node (substructures). Currently it supports five secondary structure based substructures.

This mover is not currently available in the released version of Rosetta.
