Part of the RosettaAntibody and RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) Framework

###Purpose

Run typical Rosetta protocols like minimization, docking, FastRelax, backrub, pack - [ all with or without design ] by constructing this mover.  Currently the API is not connected to RosettaScripts, but this is planned.  Use PyRosetta for now to access or email me for more information.
