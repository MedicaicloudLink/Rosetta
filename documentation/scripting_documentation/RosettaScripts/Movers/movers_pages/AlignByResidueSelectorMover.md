#AlignByResidueSelectorMover
[[include:mover_AlignByResidueSelectorMover_type]]

The mover requires both selections to have the same number of residues selected.  
Reference pose needs to be loaded/saved with the [[SavePoseMover]].

By using **ChainResidueSelector**s, this would be equivalent to [[AlignChainMover]].
