#Features reporter overview

These applications are meant for researchers interested in evaluating structure prediction protocols with respect to local structural features or researchers interested in improving a structural biology energy function.

We provide tutorials that describe an example of a concrete task as a way to orient new users.
At the end of each tutorial there references where more detailed information is provided.
If there is a specific tutorial you think or would like to see here, please add it to the list at the bottom of requested tutorials!

We also document individual FeatureReporters and R scripts useful for post-processing data.

Overview
========

In order to aid in analysis and comparisons of native protein structures and Rosetta models and designs, the Rosetta Feature Reporter framework was developed comprising an analytical framework developed in Rosetta C++ and a comparison and plotting framework developed in R, a free, open-source comprehensive statistical package. The framework was initially used to improve the default Rosetta energy function and hydrogen bonding (resulting in the once-default talaris2013 energy function), but has since been expanded for use in a number of analytical and comparative tasks. In the framework, a Feature is a component or set of components of a structure to be analyzed. These ‘features’ encompass energies, hydrogen bond distances, sequences, etc.  


A **[[FeaturesReporter|FeaturesExtracting#FeaturesReporter]]** is responsible for reading and writing a *feature* or set of *features* to a relational database (mySQL, SQLITE3, etc.). RosettaScripts is used to specify which FeatureReporters to run on a set of structures.

Comparing a set of features from two different sets of structures is done in two steps. The first step is to analyze each set of structures using a chosen number of FeatureReporters through an XML script and the RosettaScripts application. Each FeatureReporter is its own Rosetta C++ class and analyzes a set of features from the input structure and outputs one or more tables into a relational database.

Once two or more databases are created for a set of features derived from each structure in each dataset, the second step is to compare the datasets using the FeatureReporter R Framework. This framework enables one to specify the input databases to compare as well as various output options and the set of Feature R Scripts to be run through either the command line or a JSON file specifying the components (a common data interchange format used by a variety of computational languages and programs). Each Features R script requires the use of different FeatureReporters to enable the comparison, with some R scripts requiring many FeatureReporters to be used. The plots and tables output by the FeatureReporter R Framework can then be used to deduce similarities and differences between the given datasets in addition to various statistical outputs.

A features database contains all of the structural information associated with a set structures in a batch of structures. The hierarchy below outlines the general organization of this database.
