This directory contains a static capture of the Rosetta documentation wiki.  It is not supported as a user-editable wiki, but a fixed capture of its contents are released each week with new code releases.  Your weekly release should have a documentation/_site directory, which contains Home.html.  Load Home.html in the browser of your choice and the documentation will work as a non-editable wiki in the browser.
