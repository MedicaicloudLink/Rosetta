#Utility Library

The `       utility      ` library contains functions and classes which abstract concepts that are independent of the larger Rosetta project. These include such basic components as simple I/O, filesystems, algorithms & containers, portability and the like.

As with most libraries named "utility", this one is something of a grab bag.
