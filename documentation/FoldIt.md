# FoldIt

As [[xkcd popularized|http://xkcd.com/1430/]], protein folding is one of the most challenging problems.
FoldIt is a Rosetta-based game which effectively crowd-sources the protein folding problem.  
FoldIt relies on human intuition, instead of the typical Rosetta approach (Monte Carlo exploration of conformational space), to identify the native protein conformation.

For more information see the [[FoldIt homepage|https://fold.it]].
