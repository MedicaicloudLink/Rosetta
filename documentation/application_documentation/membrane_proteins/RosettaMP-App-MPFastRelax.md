# RosettaMP Application: High Resolution Refinement (MPFastRelax)

## Code and Demo
The membrane protein refinement application, MPrelax is implemented as a Rosetta Script and can be found in `Rosetta/main/source/src/apps/public/membrane/mp_relax.xml` which can be passed as input to the `rosetta_scripts.cc` executable

A demo for this application including detailed steps, command lines, and example inputs can be found in `Rosetta/demos/protocol_captures/mp_relax`

Rosetta Revision #58096

## About
High-resolution refinement is key for advancing low resolution structures from x-ray
crystallography to atomic level detail. For membrane proteins, this method can also
reveal an ensemble of possible membrane embeddings: the position and orientation of 
the biomolecule with respect to the membrane bilayer. 

## Description
The membrane relax application combines the Rosetta FastRelax algorithm with the
all atom energy function for membrane proteins and a gradient-based technique 
for optimizing the membrane embedding. First, a series of small backbone moves, 
rotamer trials, and minimization are used to refine the protein structure. In addition, 
the membrane position is optimized by minimizing the "jump" or connecting relating
the MEM residue to the biomolecule. 

This protocol is currently designed for single chain refinement with an MEM jump. Be aware that this protocol is currently not extensively tested on multi-chain proteins!

## Required Inputs
Two inputs are required for the membrane relax application: 
  (1) PDB for the protein structure of interest.
  (2) Span file describing the location of trans-membrane spans.

## Options

|**Flag**|**Description**|**Type**|

|-parser:protocol <mp_relax.xml>|Use the membrane relax protocol Rosetta script|XML Script|
|-mp:setup:spanfiles|Spanfile describing spanning topology of starting structure|String|
|-mp:scoring:hbond|Turn on depth-dependent hydrogen bonding term when using the membrane high resolution energy function|Boolean|
|-relax:fast|Use the FastRelax mode of Rosetta Relax (uses 5-8 repeat cycles)|Boolean|
|-relax:jump_move|Allow the MEM and other jumps to move during refinement|Boolean|
|-packing:prepack_missing_sidechains false|Wait to repack sidechains during pdb initialization until the membrane pose is fully initialized with the membrane framework|Boolean|

## Example Command Lines
To run this application, use the following command line: 

`./rosetta_scripts.<exe> -database /path/to/my/rosettadb @flags`
