NonlocalAbinitio 
================

File Format
-----------

### Overview

Prior knowledge about a protein's structure is conveyed to the
NonlocalAbinitio protocol by representing that information
hierarchically in a structured text file (often referred to as a
*pairings file*). Conceptually, a pairings file consists of 3 types of
entities-- *NLGrouping's*, *NLFragmentGroup's*, and *NLFragment's*.
We'll discuss these in reverse order.

*NLFragment's* contain structural information about a single residue in
a protein. This information includes residue number, backbone torsion
angles, and the Cartesian coordinates of the residue's CÎ± atom. Entries
are comma-separated and may contain leading and trailing whitespace.
Represented in [Backus-Naur
Form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form):

    <NLFragment> ::= <residue> "," <phi> "," <psi> "," <omega> "," <CA x> "," <CA y> "," <CA z> <EOL>

*NLFragment's* belonging to the same region (e.g. secondary structure
element) are grouped together by listing them consecutively, one per
line. When a newline is encountered, a new *NLFragmentGroup* is started.
Conceptually, *NLFragmentGroup's* play an analogous role to Rosetta's
core.fragment.FragData class. 
The number of *NLFragment's* in each *NLFragmentGroup* need not
be the same.

In the same manner that *NLFragmentGroup's* contained multiple
*NLFragment's*, *NLGrouping's* contain multiple *NLFragmentGroup's*.
Syntactically, *NLGrouping's* are enclosed within curly braces {}. To
motivate their use, consider the following situation. Assume we have a
predictive method for identifying contacting regions of a protein.

### Example

To take a concrete example, consider the file shown below, which defines
a single *NLGrouping* that contains 4 *NLFragmentGroup's*. The
correspondences between *NLFragmentGroup's* and protein regions are
shown below.

-   *NLFragmentGroup*~1~ (residues 2-6) =\> red
-   *NLFragmentGroup*~2~ (residues 49-54) =\> blue
-   *NLFragmentGroup*~3~ (residues 66-80) =\> orange
-   *NLFragmentGroup*~4~ (residues 84-88) =\> yellow

### Code

The data types defined above are located in
NLFragment.hh, NLFragmentGroup.hh, and NLGrouping.hh
respectively. *NLGrouping's* can be constructed in one of two ways. They
can be read explicitly from file using NonlocalAbinitioReader's 
static read() method.

    #include <protocols/abinitio/NonlocalAbinitioReader.hh>
    ...

    vector1<NLGrouping> groupings;
    NonlocalAbinitioReader::read("test.pairings", &groupings);

Alternately, *NLGrouping's* can be constructed programmatically. A good
example can be found in the file protocols/abinitio/util.cc.
A SequenceAlignment
and template PDB are converted into a set of *NLGrouping's* for use in
the NonlocalAbinitio protocol.
