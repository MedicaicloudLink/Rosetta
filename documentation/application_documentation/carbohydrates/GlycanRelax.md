Description
===========

App: glycan_relax


Glycan Relax aims to sample potential conformational states of carbohydrates, either attached to a protein or free.  It is extremely fast.  Currently, it uses a few strategies to do so, using statistics from various papers, the CHI (CarboHydrate Intrinsic) energy term, and a new framework for backbone dihedral sampling. Conformer statistics adapted from Schief lab Glycan Relax app, originally used/written by Yih-En Andrew Ban.

It can model glycans from ideal geometry, or refine already-modeling glycans.
