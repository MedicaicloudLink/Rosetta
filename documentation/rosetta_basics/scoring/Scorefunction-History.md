Rosetta's scorefunction has gone though many changes over the years. This page documents some of the landmarks.

An introductory tutorial on how to score biomolecules using Rosetta can be found [here](https://www.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/scoring/scoring).

Which scorefunction?
====================

Rosetta has never relied exclusively on a single scorefunction (except maybe in its earliest incarnation).  Popular protocols like [[relax]] and [[ab initio|abinitio relax]] use different scorefunctions at different points in their execution. Since the advent of [[design|fixbb]] in Rosetta, most applications stick to a single scorefunction.

* Rohl CA, Strauss CE, Misura KM, Baker D (2004) [Protein structure prediction using Rosetta.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15063647) (pubmed link)  
Methods in Enzymology.  
This paper, often called the **Rohl review**, is a window into Rosetta's early scorefunction, and remains an excellent reference for early forms of the score function terms. It can be a little hard to find online, but paper photocopies float around most Rosetta labs.

* Kuhlman B, Dantas G, Ireton GC, Varani G, Stoddard BL, Baker D (2003)  
[Design of a novel globular protein fold with atomic-level accuracy.] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631033) (pubmed link)  
Science 302:1364-8  
This paper, often called the **Top7 paper**, is primarily a design paper (see below), but is important for scoring as it introduces sequence-related energy terms (reference energies, p_aa_pp, etc), and is the closest reference for "where **score12** came from".
The supplemental is most relevant for scoring.

Scorefunctions timeline
=======================
*Rosetta2 / pre-score12 days -- ????

* **Score12** was the gold standard from the beginning of the Rosetta3 era up until the release of Talaris13.  This is substantially similar to the scorefunction discussed in the [[Top7 paper|Glossary#top7-top7-paper]] above.  The 12 has no particular meaning - it was the 12th scorefunction listed in the database.

* **Score12_correct** was widely discussed at [[RosettaCON|Glossary#RosettaCON]]s for several years running as a collection of terms to improve Score12's performance.  It was never adopted wholesale.

* **Talaris13** was the result of a meeting (held at a hotel named Talaris) where the community used [[OptE|opt-e-parallel-doc]] and many new scorefunction tests to try to improve on Score12.  It was denoted 13 both as a successor to score12 and because it was developed in 2013.

* **Talaris14** is an error-correction of Talaris13.  One of the hydrogen bonding weights was incorrect.  All the weights were re-scaled to more closely match the Rosetta Energy Unit size of score12 - ultimately the units are arbitrary but better comparison with score12 was desired.  The YHH_planarity term was added to help control the alcohol hydrogen in tyrosine.  This was developed in 2014, but not put into use until 2016.

* **REF2015** was developed as [[beta_nov15|Overview of Seattle Group energy function optimization project]] and became the default scorefunction in July 2017.  Beta_nov16 is under development behind it.
