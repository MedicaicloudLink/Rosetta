<!-- --- title: Fasta File -->

Sequence data contains sequences of residues without structural data. The derivation and accuracy of such files is the subject of research but the formats tend to be simple.

Name
====

```
*.fasta
```

Application purpose
===========================================

Sequence information generated by the FASTA sequence alignment package.

Format
======

The format of FASTA is described [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/fasta.shtml)

Example
=======

In this example 2ptl\_ is the identifier (using the name of the PDB). 1-120 describes the range of residues the file contains. : Example B.9. FASTA

```
>2ptl_ 1-120
VTIKANLIFANGSTQTAEFKGTFEKATSEAYAYADTLKKDNGEYTVDVAD
KGYTLNIKFAAAAAVTIKANLIFANGSTQTAEFKGTFEKATSEAYAYADTLKKD
NGEYTVDVADKGYTLNIKFA
```

Some applications, including [[stepwise|stepwise]] and [[rna_denovo|rna-denovo]], take several chains as input, and allow chain and residues to be specified in tags like `C:10-121` in the FASTA headers.
