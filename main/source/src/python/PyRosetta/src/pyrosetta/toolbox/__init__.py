"""Brief:   A toolbox of exposed methods for use in PyRosetta.

Remarks: These methods are useful in PyRosetta and are further intended to
         demonstrate proper syntax for various common activities.

         ONLY essential, tested, PyRosetta-exclusive methods should live here!
         Remember, the rest of the Python scripts in "toolbox/" are NOT
         supported, just provided, (ex. environment setup scripts, etc.).

         For those interested, Rosetta has a Surface Area calculator and a
         Radius of Gyration calculator; they are EnergyMethods sa and rg,
         respectively. Create an empty ScoreFunction and use
         ScoreFunction.set_weight to use these calculations.
         Other common geometry calculators are CA_rmsd and all_atom_rmsd.
