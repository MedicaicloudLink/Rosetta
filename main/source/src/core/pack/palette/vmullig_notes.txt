When the packer is invoked:
-- The PackerTask (PackerTask_) gets created with the PackerTask_(pose) constructor.  This initializes the vector of ResidueLevelTasks (or ResidueLevelTask_s) for the pose, one for each position.
-- Initialization of a ResidueLevelTask_ involves creating vectors of ResidueTypes for the position, with the types variant-matched to the existing residue.
-- TaskOperations can add noncanonicals to the vector of ResidueTypes for a position.
-- So the sensible thing to do is:
     -- Modify the PackerTask_(pose) constructor to take a PackerPalette as well.
     -- Let the PackerPalette operate on the ResidueLevelTask_.
     -- Have it pass the list of allowed base types and allowed variant types to the ResidueLevelTask_.
     -- Have it pass enums for special behaviour (e.g. allow all with matching variant types; allow non-matching variant types; etc.) to the ResidueLevelTask_, which modify how the ResidueLevelTask_ sets itself up.
