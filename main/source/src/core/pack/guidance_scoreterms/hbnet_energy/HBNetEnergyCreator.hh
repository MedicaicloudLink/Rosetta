/// @brief Creator for an EnergyMethod that gives a bonus for hydrogen bond networks, which ramps nonlinearly with the size of the
/// networks.
/// @details This energy method is inherently not pairwise decomposible.  However, it is intended for very rapid calculation,
/// and has been designed to plug into Alex Ford's modifications to the packer that permit it to work with non-pairwise scoring
/// terms.
