/// @brief Creator for an EnergyMethod intended for packing, which penalizes solutions in which the total volume to fill differs greatly
/// from the total volume of the current set of rotamers.
/// @details This energy method is inherently not pairwise decomposible.  However, it is intended for very rapid calculation,
/// and has been designed to plug into Alex Ford's modifications to the packer that permit it to work with non-pairwise scoring
/// terms.
