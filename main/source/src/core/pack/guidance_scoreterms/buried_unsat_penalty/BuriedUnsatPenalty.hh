/// @brief Headers for an EnergyMethod that gives a penalty for buried unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.
/// @details This energy method is inherently not pairwise decomposible.  However, it is intended for very rapid calculation,
/// and has been designed to plug into Alex Ford's modifications to the packer that permit it to work with non-pairwise scoring
/// terms.
/// @note This was updated on 21 September 2018 to ensure that, during a packing trajectorym, only buried unsatisfied groups that are (a) on packable
/// rotamers, or (b) that are on non-packable rotamers, but which can hydrogen-bond to at least one packable rotamer are the only ones that count towards
/// the penalty.  Without this, "native" buried unsats that are unreachable in a packing problem contribute unreasonably to the total score.  (Thanks to
/// Kale Kundert for identifying the problem.)
