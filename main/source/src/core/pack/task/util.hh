///@brief Take a Design Sequence Motif (like a simple version of a resfile), and parse into a list of ResfileCommands.
/// These commands can then be used to do whatever you want with, including non-cannonicals.
///
/// This is used in the CreateSequenceMotifMover and the SequenceMotifTaskOperation interfaces.
///
///@details
///
///  This is slightly similar to a regex, but not quite. We are not matching a sequence, we are designing in a motif regardless of the current sequence, anywhere in a protein.
///
///   - Each letter corresponds to a position. Using [ ] indicates a more complicated expression for that position.
///   - An X indicates it can be anything, and that we are designing here.
///   - An AA Letter, like V, indicates that that position will be designed to a V.
///   - A - charactor indicates that that position stays with whatever it is currently.  We essentially skip this position.
///   - An expression like: [^PAV] indicates that we will design anything except Proline, Alanine, and Valine
///   - An expression like: [NTS] indicates that that position can be Asparigine, Threonine, or Serine and only of these will be enabled during the design.
///   - RESFILE commands are accepted as well.
///      These require a % Charactor to start the whole line off.
///      For example [%POLAR] is totally cool, as is [%PIKAA ST].
///
///       (Non-cannonical, DNA, RNA, etc. should all work here!!)
///
/// EXAMPLE:
///  Glycosylation N-Linked motif design: N[^P][ST]
