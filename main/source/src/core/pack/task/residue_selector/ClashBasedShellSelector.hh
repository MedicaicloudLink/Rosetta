/// @brief Define a shell based on potential sidechain clashes with a set of
/// residues being repacked or designed.
///
/// The most common reason to use a clash-based shell is to pick a minimal set
/// of residues to repack around some positions you want to design.  For most
/// simple cases, the ClashBasedRepackShell task operation is the best way to
/// do this.  Use ClashBasedShellSelector if you want to combine the repack
/// shell with other selections (e.g. repack everything that's in the first two
/// repack shells but not more than 6Ã… from a certain residue), or do something
/// else entirely.
///
/// The best way to specify which residues to build the shell around (called
/// the "focus" residues, see set_focus()) is to use a TaskFactory.  This is
/// because task factories know which rotamers go in each position, so each one
/// can be checked for clashes.  You can also specify focus residues using a
/// ResidueSelector.  In this case rotamers will be generated for only the
/// native amino acid (i.e. assuming the positions are being repacked) and
/// checked for clashes as usual.
///
/// If you ask for more than one shell (see set_num_shells()), the shell
/// calculation will be iterated, with the residues found at each step included
/// as inputs for the next.  The residues added in this manner are treated as
/// repackable for the purpose of making shells (i.e. only rotamers of the
/// native amino acid are considered).
///
/// This class mainly exists to provide a RosettaScripts interface for
/// selecting clash-based shells.  If you want to select such a shell from C++,
/// the find_clashing_shells() function will be simpler and easier to use.
///
/// In order for a residue the be included in the clash-based shell, its
/// sidechain must have a steric clash with one of the rotamers allowed for one
/// of the focus residues.  Furthermore, that rotamer must not have any
/// backbone clashes with any other residue.  Backbone clashes can't be
/// resolved by the packer, so there's no point considering rotamers that clash
/// with the backbone.  Clashes are defined entirely by inter-atomic distance
/// and do not depend on any particular score terms.
///
/// Think twice before using ClashBasedShellSelector or ClashBasedRepackShell
/// if you're running many simulations with different backbones, because you
/// may end up picking different shells in different simulations.  Repacking
/// different sets of residues can make scores hard to compare, especially if
/// your input structure isn't relaxed.
///
/// If you want to understand exactly why ClashBasedShellSelector either
/// included or excluded a particular residue, run rosetta with the
/// `-out:levels core.pack.task.residue_selector.ClashBasedShellSelector:trace`
/// flag.
