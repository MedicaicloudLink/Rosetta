/**
One thing that is not nailed down is whether a single ResidueTypeSet can have ResidueTypes with different AtomTypeSets. (PB-07/07)

The answer is NO -- or at least a ResidueTypeSet shouldn't have ResidueTypes with different mode() values,
which in most cases are determined by the AtomTypeSet being used. -
Though two different AtomTypeSets with the same mode may be permitted. (RM-11/16)
