# To add a new property to Rosetta for use in .params files, patch files, and
# ResidueTypes, simply add a string to this list and run
# update_ResidueType_enum_files.py.
# (You may also consider adding new is_ accessors to ResidueType and Residue.)

# This is Part 1 of a major refactor of the properties system.  Eventually,
# there will be separate lists of properties for separate classifications of
# ResidueTypes as well as a general list of properties.  For now, all
# properties belong in this file.

# Comments added inline with a property will be converted to C++ comments, so
# please feel free to add clarifications/definitions here.

SRI # New class of artificial heteropolymers. ~VMulligan
TRIAZOLE_LINKER # Another new class of artificial heteropolymers. ~Vmulligan
METAL  # This residue type is a metal ion.
SURFACE
WATER
TP3 # A particular type of water.  This is used by the residue type setup machinery for the packer, and having this as a property avoids some string parsing.
VIRTUALIZABLE_BY_PACKER # Indicate that, during packing, this residue type can be converted to or from a virtual residue type.
SOLVENT
VIRTUAL_RESIDUE
VRT1 # A particular type of virtual residue.  This is used by the residue type setup machinery for the packer, and having this as a property avoids some string parsing.
INVERTED_VIRTUAL_RESIDUE #Used by the symmetry machinery for mirror symmetry. ~Vmulligan

## Variants
LOWER_TERMINUS  # polymeric residue which cannot be connected through the lower connect
UPPER_TERMINUS  # polymeric residue which cannot be connected through the upper connect
BRANCH_POINT    # A polymeric residue which contains a non-polymeric connection, or a nonpolymeric residue which contains three or more
TERMINUS	# Contains a single (non-polymeric) connection
# (Do we need a non-polymeric type with two connections, or is that an oxymoron?)
LOWERTERM_TRUNC
UPPERTERM_TRUNC
COARSE  # currently for coarse_RNA only
ADDUCT

FRAGMENT # shows up in GrowLigand
UPPERTERM_CAP

## Qualitative Properties
POLAR #This is for clearly polar side-chains (DEHKNQRST).  Note that it excludes glycine, alanine, cysteine, and proline (as well as very hydrophobic residues with polar groups, like tryptophan or tyrosine).
HYDROPHOBIC #This is for clearly hydrophobic side-chains (FMILYVW).  Note that it also excludes glycine, alanine, cysteine, and proline.  The union of POLAR and HYDROPHOBIC does NOT include all amino acids.
CHARGED
NEGATIVE_CHARGE #Has a negative charge.  Includes zwitterionic side-chains.
POSITIVE_CHARGE #Has a positive charge.  Includes zwitterionic side-chains.
AROMATIC
ALIPHATIC #Has a side-chain (i.e. not gly) and the side-chain contains only carbon and hydrogen, with no aromatic rings.  Methionine is included as an "honourary" aliphatic, so the set is: ALA, VAL, ILE, LEU, PRO, MET.
CYCLIC
METALBINDING  # This residue type is a one capable of binding to a metal ion.
SIDECHAIN_THIOL # This residue type is capable of forming a disulfide bond
DISULFIDE_BONDED  # This residue type contains a disulfide bond/noncanonical connection
ELECTROPHILE # This residue type has a side-chain that can be conjugated to a nucleophile (for example, it contains an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl)
SIDECHAIN_AMINE
N_METHYLATED # A methyl group replaces the amide proton in residues in the MIDDLE of a sequence (not at the N-terminus)

## Membranes
MEMBRANE

PHOSPHONATE  # amino phosphonic acid instead of amino carboxylic acid

# AMINO-ACID-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES
ALPHA_AA
BETA_AA
GAMMA_AA
L_AA #Chirality.  This is defined as the chirality of the first chiral mainchain atom closest to the LOWER_CONNECT -- so a trisubstituted 2D,3D,4L-gamma-amino acid would be considered an L_AA.
D_AA #Chirality.  This is defined as the chirality of the first chiral mainchain atom closest to the LOWER_CONNECT -- so a trisubstituted 2L,3L,4D-gamma-amino acid would be considered a D_AA.
ACHIRAL_BACKBONE
ACHIRAL_SIDECHAIN
R_PEPTOID #Chirality of peptoid sidechain.  R-chirality peptoids are auto-generaetd from their S-chirality counterparts. 
S_PEPTOID #Chirality of peptoid sidechain.  Only S-chirality peptoids are allowed in the Rosetta database.
