"   - An AA Letter, like V, indicates that that position will be designed to a V.\n"
"   - A - charactor indicates that that position stays with whatever it is currently.  We essentially skip this position.\n"
"   - An expression like: [^PAV] indicates that we will design anything except Proline, Alanine, and Valine \n"
"   - An expression like: [NTS] indicates that that position can be Asparigine, Threonine, or Serine and \n"
"      only these will be enabled during the design.\n"
"   - RESFILE commands are accepted as well. These require a % charactor in from of the whole expression.\n"
