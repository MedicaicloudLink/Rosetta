The namespace core::pack_basic is reserved for classes that meet the following requirements:

1. The class should properly be in core::pack, but...
2. It is needed by something in core.3.

Presumably though, many classes that meet 1. and 2. should be put in core::conformation. Which
  is  where requirement 3. appears.

3. The class needs to include something from core.3
