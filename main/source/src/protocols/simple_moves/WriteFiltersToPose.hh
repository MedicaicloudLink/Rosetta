/// @brief Writes the results from all filters to the pose file.
/// @details This mover goes through all filters in the RosettaScripts file and writes their
/// user-defined name, (optionally) their filter type, and their numerical result to the
/// output .pdb file. The include_type option writes the filter type.
/// The user can also specify a prefix to append before the user-defined
/// filter name; for instance, let's say there is a PackStat filter, as well as several movers like
/// fastdesign and docking. The "prefix" option allows the user to have several versions of
/// WriteFiltersToPose which take the filter results from different steps in the process.
/// If the RosettaScripts XML file has these instances of WriteFiltersToPose:
///      <WriteFiltersToPose name="writer1" prefix="post_fastdesign_"/>
///      <WriteFiltersToPose name="writer2" prefix="post_docking_" include_type="true"/>
/// If the only filter is a PackStat filter named "packing",
/// the output pdb will have two lines at the end that look something like this:
///      post_docking_packing PackStat 0.6794
///      post_fastdesign_packing 0.6751
/// If there are multiple filters, each instance of this mover will write all
/// filters to the pose.
///
/// Note: If you would like to only write a single filter result to your pose,
/// use FilterReportAsPoseExtraScoresMover
