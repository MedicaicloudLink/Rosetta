	///@brief Set a string that tells this operation how to design.
	///@details
	///  This is slightly similar to a regex, but not quite. We are not matching a sequence, we are designing in a motif regardless of the current sequence, anywhere in a protein.
	///
	///   - Each letter corresponds to a position. Using [ ] indicates a more complicated expression for that position.
	///   - An X indicates it can be anything, and that we are designing here.
	///   - An AA Letter, like V, indicates that that position will be designed to a V.
	///   - A - charactor indicates that that position stays with whatever it is currently.  We essentially skip this position.
	///   - An expression like: [^PAV] indicates that we will design anything except Proline, Alanine, and Valine
	///   - An expression like: [NTS] indicates that that position can be Asparigine, Threonine, or Serine and only of these will be enabled during the design.
	///   - RESFILE commands are accepted as well. Resfile commands need a % in front of the whole set.
	///      FOr example [%POLAR] is totally cool.

	///  Glycosylation N-Linked motif design: N[^P][ST]
