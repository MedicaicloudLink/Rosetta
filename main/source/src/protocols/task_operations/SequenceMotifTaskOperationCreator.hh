/// @file   protocols/task_operations/SequenceMotifTaskOperation.cc
/// @brief  Creator for A TaskOp that takes a regex-like pattern and turns it into a set of design residues.  The string should identify what to do for each position.  An X indicates any residue, and is the same as [A_Z].  Anything other than a charactor should be in [].  The ^ denotes a not.  An example Regex for glycosylation is NX[ST].  This would design an ASN into the first position, skip the second, and allow S and T mutations only at the third position.  N[^P][ST] would denote that at the second position, we do not allow proline.  Sets of charactors using _ can be denoted, even though this doesnt really help us in design.  In the future one can imagine having sets of polars, etc. etc.  This TaskOp is like a simple RESFILE in a string.
