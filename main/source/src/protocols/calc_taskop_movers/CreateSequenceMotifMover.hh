///@brief Simple mover to Create a sequence motif in a region of protein using the SequenceMotifTaskOperation.  Uses psueo-regular expressions to define the motif.
///
///@details
/// Simply calls the packer using the operation, optionally packing neighbor residues as it does so.
/// If you need something more complex, use the SequenceMotifTaskOperation directly.
///
///MOTIF:
///
///  This is slightly similar to a regex, but not quite. We are not matching a sequence, we are designing in a motif regardless of the current sequence, anywhere in a protein.
///
///   - Each letter corresponds to a position. Using [ ] indicates a more complicated expression for that position.
///   - An X indicates it can be anything, and that we are designing here.
///   - An AA Letter, like V, indicates that that position will be designed to a V.
///   - A - charactor indicates that that position stays with whatever it is currently.  We essentially skip this position.
///   - An expression like: [^PAV] indicates that we will design anything except Proline, Alanine, and Valine
///   - An expression like: [NTS] indicates that that position can be Asparigine, Threonine, or Serine and only of these will be enabled during the design.
///   - RESFILE commands are accepted as well. FOr example [POLAR] is totally cool.  Separate these by commas.
///
/// EXAMPLE:
///  Glycosylation N-Linked motif design: N[^P][ST]
