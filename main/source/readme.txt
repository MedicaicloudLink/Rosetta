<< Building >>

In order to build a debug version of the mini-rosetta executables, simply run
scons like this:

scons bin

In order to build release executables, add the flag 'mode=release' like this:

scons bin mode=release

To display more rosetta specific build options call
scons -h
To display general scons build options call
scons -H

Instructions for native builds on OSX using XCode and Windows using Visual
Studio to follow soon.

<< Additional Build Environment Setup >>

Automatic location of other compilers (assuming they are already in
your path) such as Intel C/C++ may be enabled by uncommenting the
"program_path" line in 'tools/build/user.settings'.

A user can restrict compilation of the the devel and pilot_apps. On issuing
the call

scons bin my
or
scons bin my_pilot_apps

SCons will read from src/devel.src.settings and src/pilot_apps.src.settings
rather than src/devel.src.settings.all and src/pilot_apps.src.settings.all
This cuase SCons to build only the sources listed in src/devel.src.settings
and src/pilot_apps.src.settings with the needed dependencies.

<< Common build calls that may be useful >>

    scons
        Build the default projects with default settings (debug mode, shared
libs)

    scons <project>
        Build the target <project> with default settings

    scons <project>/<subdirectory>
        Build only the sources of <project> in <subdirectory>

    scons <project>/<path/<objectfile>
        Build only <objectfile>

    scons bin
        Build and install executables in bin/ directory

    scons -D #bin
        Build and install executables in bin/ directory if current
        working directory is a sub-directory mini. -D options tells
        scons to iteratively search towards the root for SConstruct
        file. The # sign is an alias for the top build directory.

    scons bin
    scons bin pilot_apps_all
        Build all pilot_apps listed in src/pilot_apps.src.settings.all
        and sources in src/devel.src.settings as well as the core, numeric
        and utility libraries

    scons bin my
    scons bin my_pilot_apps
        Build restricted set of pilot_apps and devel sources listed in
        src/pilot_apps.src.settings.my and src/devel.src.settings.my

    scons bin/exec
        Build and install a particular executable in the bin directory
        e.g
        scons bin/benchmark.linuxgccdebug
        scons mode=release bin/benchmark.linuxgccrelease

    scons mode=release
        Build in release mode (~10x faster executable)

    scons extras=static
        Static linking instead of shared libraries (more portable)

    scons cat=test
    python test/run.py
        Build and run unit tests. (Note the sources must be built first.)

    scons -j3
        Parallelize build into 3 threads (faster on multiproc. machine)

    python external/scons-local/scons.py
        Use the version of scons that is distributed with mini
        (Hint: use if scons is not installed on system)
