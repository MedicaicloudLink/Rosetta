# To use this file, symlink tools/build/site.settings to this file (or copy this file to that location)

# Settings here are added to the combined build settings, after all basic
# settings, to allow you to override anything you need to.  They can in turn
# be overriden by user settings and project settings respectively.
#
# Typically you want to prepend to one of the settings listed to expand your
# paths, but you can also append, override, or remove settings.

# JJG 3/1/2013:
# These are settings for the stampede cluster at stampede.tacc.utexas.edu.
# These settings are for compiling with intel, the compiler loaded by default

# mpacella 2/26/2015:
# These setting have now been updated for compatibility with the new pointer
# system in Rosetta.  Thanks to Cyrus Proctor for helping me develop these
