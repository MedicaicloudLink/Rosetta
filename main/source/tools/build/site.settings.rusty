# Settings here are added to the combined build settings, after all basic
# settings, to allow you to override anything you need to.  They can in turn
# be overriden by user settings and project settings respectively.
#
# Typically you want to prepend to one of the settings listed to expand your
# paths, but you can also append, override, or remove settings.

# These settings are for the Iron/Rusty cluster used by the Simons Foundation / Flatiron Institute.
# They were added on 4 November 2018 by Vikram K. Mulligan (vmulligan@flatironinstitute.org).

# Allow querying the operating system:
import os

        "prepends" : {
        },
        "appends" : {
	    # Use the environment's program path:
            "program_path"  : os.environ["PATH"].split(":"),

	    # Optimize aggressively for the hardware.  (Note that the
	    # default settings of march=core2, mtune=generic are removed
	    # below.
