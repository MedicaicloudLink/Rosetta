# Settings here are added to the combined build settings, after all basic
# settings, to allow you to override anything you need to.  They can in turn
# be overriden by user settings and project settings respectively.
#
# Typically you want to prepend to one of the settings listed to expand your
# paths, but you can also append, override, or remove settings.

# These settings are for the UCSD Gordon cluster used by the Simons Foundation / Flatiron Institute.
# They were added on 13 October 2018 by Vikram K. Mulligan (vmulligan@flatironinstitute.org).
