# in it. This file will get processed with the --root switch which adds a main() method to the

# Some of the unit tests read in text files. Hardcoding the location of the text files or taking the text in the
# file and placing it into a string variable in the code are both less than ideal solutions.  Having smaller versions
# of the files along with the test code seems to be the best solution.  However, the test executables get built in
# the build directory.  When running them there, the text files are still in the test/ subdirectories.  We need to
# have a separate command to copy text files used by test cases from test/ to the right build subdirectory.
#
# To get Scons to copy the file appropriately, we make an explicit dependancy between the main test executable and
# the copied file location. We then use a Copy builder to set up the file copy. Doing it this way means that only
# the files which have gotten changed will be copied, and they'll get copied any time they do change.
# The trick is to use the "#" prefixing on the scons source/target notation to get Scons to realize that the paths
# we're giving it are relative to the root directory.
# The one drawback of how it is currently structured is that if any of the the text file inputs change, you'll relink
# the test executable, even though you don't have to.
