# MMTF Test Suite

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

*Version*: v0.2dev

The test suite provides a number of files in different formats to facilitate testing and validations of encoder/decoder implementations. The formats are:

* MMTF (all fields are encoded according to the specification and serialized using MessagePack to a binary file)
* encoded JSON (all fields are encoded and serialized to a JSON file)
* decoded JSON (all fields are decoded and serialized to a JSON file)

Further, there is a [list of files](file-list.json) with comments on why they are included in the test suite.
