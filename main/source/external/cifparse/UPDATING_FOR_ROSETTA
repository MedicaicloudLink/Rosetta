## This directory

This directory contains the CIFPARSE-OBJ C++ Parser from Rutgers, the RCSB and the wwPDB.
<http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/sw-examples/cpp/html/index.html>

See the VERSION file for the current version number information.

See the LICENSE file for the licensing information of CIFPARSE-OBJ, and 
regex_COPYRIGHT copyright for the included regex library. Other files may 
have additional licensing information included in their text. 
(Note that Rosetta explicitly invokes the "special exception" clause in 
the parser-generator generated files CifParser.* and DICParser.*) 

### Updating.

1. As some of the files are generated from lex/yacc//flex/bison files, it's useful to build CIFPARSE-OBJ 
using the provided MakeFiles to generate these files. (Rosetta does not have lex/yacc//flex/bison integration.)

2. After compiling, ignore the compiled files and copy all the *.C, *.c, *.h and *.ih files from the CIFPARSE-OBJ directory 
(except for the main()-containing test files in the parser-test-app/ directory) to the Rosetta/main/source/external/cifparse/ 
directory. 

3. Update Rosetta/main/source/external/cifparse.external.settings, if necessary, to update the files which need to be compiled.
(The Rosetta build system should be able to handle invoking the appropriate compiler for *.C and *.c files.)

4. The regex directory is an external library for CIFPARSE-OBJ. Special care is needed for these files. 
Particularly, some *.c files (e.g. engine.c) are actually pseudo-header files which should not be compiled separately.
Additionally, I've found that you may need to change some `#include <regex.h>` into `#include "regex.h"` to get the compiler
not to choke on the include search paths.

5. I found that `#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 1` needed to be added at the top of *Scanner.c files in order to silence some compiler warnings.

6. Copy over some of the fixes for Windows build. e.g. You may need to handle includes of the Posix-only unistd.h. Other changes are lalso needed - grep the current codebase for WIN32 for more.

7. Be sure to update the VERSION, LICENSE, and regex COPYRIGHT notices, if necessary, along with any other such file which might be added.
(Some of the README files seems to be unnecessary, as they talk only about installation.)
