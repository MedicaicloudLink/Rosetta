/**
**  \class ITTable
** 
**  \brief Private class that respresents a two-dimensional table of strings.
** 
**  This class represents a two-dimensional table of cells. Each cell holds
**  a text string. The table is identified by its name. Rows are horizontal
**  table entities identified by row indices, which are unsigned integers
**  ranging from zero to the number of rows minus one. Columns are vertical
**  table entities identified by (non-empty) column names. Column names can
**  be case-sensitive (by default) or case-insensitive (customizable during
**  construction). The class provides methods for table construction and
**  destruction, assignment operator, equal operator, column and row based
**  methods for addition, insertion, retrieval, update, deletion, cell
**  based methods for update and retrieval, column search methods and table
**  printing. Table cells are internally stored as vectors of text strings,
**  where vectors can represent either columns (by default) or rows
**  (customizable during construction).
