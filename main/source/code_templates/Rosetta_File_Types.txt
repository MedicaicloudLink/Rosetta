File types:
-----------
  *.fwd.hh - Header files with forward declarations for the class contained
             in the equivalent *.hh.   The .hh will include the .fwd.hh as
             its first header.
             If no classes are present then there is no .fwd.hh: all forward
             declared free functions live in a .hh as per normal.
             *.fwd.hh exists to improve compilation time.  Anytime the
             class is being used by pointer, smart pointer or reference only
             the .fwd.hh should be included instead of the .hh
  *.hh     - Header file templates
  *.cc     - Source file templates.
  *.dox    - Doxygen templates.

  <package>.fwd.hh -
            Header for the forward declarations of the entire package.
            This should #include all the other .fwd.hh files.  If this affects
            compilation time adversely, individual .fwd.hh files should be used
            instead.
  <package>.dox -
            Doxygen file for the entire package.
